Eco-narratives are intended to enable managers and practitioners to rapidly ascertain the ecological characteristics of each park, and to highlight knowledge gaps for future research focus. Gascoyne Marine Park is dominated by two submarine canyons that incise the continental slope of the western Australian margin and provide some degree of connectivity between the continental shelf and abyssal plain. The park is characterised by a range of benthic environments, including near-vertical cliffs of exposed bedrock in the canyons, and sediment covered slopes on the continental slope that grade to abyssal plains that occupy the greater proportion of the park.",2021,28/6/2021 3:51,22/3/2023 4:06,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,nespmarine.edu.au,"Canberra, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2021,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\J9QAG5ZL\Post et al. - 2021 - An eco-narrative of the Gascoyne Marine Park, Nort.pdf",,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records

This created opportunities for reconnection to traditional language and cultural knowledge through physical, spiritual, and environmental practices with plants and animals on country. This project was designed to reconnect and engage Kamilaroi women with their language and cultural knowledge. The practical experience of linking western science names and knowledge for plants and animals to language names and traditional science opened a safe space for women to rediscover and share their personal and ancestral knowledge about these plants and animals. Women's language and culture networks, based in Walgett and Boggabilla, NSW, were created and involved Kamilaroi women interested in the use, promotion, development, and protection of their languages and cultural knowledge. Information about each plant and animal was collected through the network and included names in the Kamilaroi languages: Yuwaalaraay, Yuwaalayaay, and Gamilaraay/Gamilaroi/Kamilaroi, and ecological knowledge about its purpose, relationships, and character. Information deemed suitable for publication was included in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), Australia's free national biodiversity database. The ALA now includes Kamilaroi knowledge for more than 300 species, and for the first time directly links Kamilaroi and western science knowledge on a free and high-profile public forum. This project is on-going, to-date it has proved the catalyst for change in women's well-being.

Participation in citizen science projects has been supported via the CSIRO and the Australian Citizen Science Association's Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder. The Project Finder is a one-stop resource that makes it easy to search for vetted projects that can contribute to our understanding of bushfire recovery. Already these projects are demonstrating lasting impact through Page 96 of 135 augmentation of both data quantity and quality of research. Here we provide case studies of where citizen science is having impact. For example, across two discreet digital application projects alone, hundreds of citizen scientists have recorded and validated more than 10,000 observations and have documented over 1300 species in bushfire impacted regions. Citizen science also has huge capacity to scale biosecurity efforts for bushfire recovery. Already citizen scientists are undertaking surveys for new weed or pest incursions in fire impacted regions. Despite these examples, there remains significant untapped potential for greater public involvement in recovery efforts.  The report on Climate and Disaster Resilience recognises the importance of citizen science in complementing traditional research-led monitoring campaigns, and in sharing locally specific advice. One component of the response also brought together national stakeholders, to develop a series of more detailed recommendations regarding the critical role of citizen science. With that in mind, the task now moves to improving integration of the 'professional' scientific capability with the citizen science effort, to better harness the potential of citizen science.",2020,13/5/2021 3:29,13/5/2021 3:33,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,Virtual,not specified,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,,,ALA author; TBC

Since its international debut, the platypus has fascinated the scientific community. The past 200 years of scholarly literature is peppered with journal articles containing taxonomic revisions and details of the bizarre biology and behaviour of this paradoxical species. Yet, despite the fact that much of this historic literature is now accessible online, it is almost impossible to find. This is because, unlike contemporary scientific publications, much of the digitised historical literature lacks article-level citation data and digital object identifiers (DOIs). This paper will detail the work the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is undertaking to bring the world's historic literature into the modern linked network of scholarly research. It will present three case studies - three ""lost"" platypus articles from three very different publications - to demonstrate how the retrospective registration of DOIs is critical to making legacy literature discoverable, citable and trackable. This paper will also discuss the responsibility and accountability that comes with assigning DOIs, including best practice for out-of-copyright and orphaned content, and the issues that arise when the definitive (DOI'd) versions of public domain journal articles are locked behind paywalls.",2020,13/5/2021 3:16,13/5/2021 3:33,13/5/2021 3:16,e59089,,,4,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,Virtual,not specified,,,,,GS 2020,,10.3897/biss.4.59089,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\53TSPWKC\Kearney - 2020 - Discovering the Platypus From its scientific desc.pdf,,ALA author; TBC

Such a move is expected to bring the benefits of consistent data handling, improved bibliographic citation tracking, coordinated deployment of new features across the entire data publishing community, better reuse of modules and an overall reduction in cost of development, deployment and operation. This year, work has commenced to align these two infrastructures, focussing initially on data ingestion pipelines. The GBIF and ALA teams are collaborating closely, working on the same codebase, developing common working practices and agreeing on tools and coding standards. This focus on collaboration will lead to a defined model for the Living Atlas community to provide contributions. This work will also further the efforts to hand ownership of core ALA systems to the Living Atlas community and pave the way for the Living Atlas community to transition to the adoption of GBIF systems.

Despite a documented national population decline of 80-85% since 2004, including the loss of 23,000 animals (~32%) in a single heat stress event in November 2018, management activities are still focused on control of the species rather than conservation. Page 116 of 135 While major threats to the population are habitat loss, particularly of foraging habitat, cyclones and climate change, spectacled flying-foxes can still be dispersed from most camps without referral to the EPBC Act, and illegal harassment and shooting are known to occur. Past and current management activities have not only contributed to the population loss but also hinder conservation efforts. Indeed, public perception may be the biggest threat to the conservation of this threatened flying-fox. This project aims to improve perceptions and educate the community to promote a public will for the species' conservation by engaging people in a citizen science project recording observations of where they see flying-foxes feeding and roosting. Data collected from the surveys will be entered into the Living Atlas of Australia and will add to our knowledge of the species, complementing the CSIRO monitoring. This will help identify critical roosting habitat for rehabilitation and restoration to reduce the impacts of future heat-stress and other climatic events.

The digitization of this information, including the transcription of the Darwin Core (DC) terms from the text in photographs, is currently performed through human-oriented processes that rely on input from experts or consensus from crowdsourced work. Previous studies utilized heuristics, only applicable to a couple of DC terms, for their semi-automated extraction. In this paper, we propose a human-in-the-loop workflow for the general extraction of DC terms. The workflow utilizes crowdsourced data to iteratively train a named-entity recognition model for the extraction of the DC terms. Because the source text can contain errors from the optical character recognition process, the extracted values are validated by a confidence estimation structure of frequency lists. These lists are created from millions of previously digitized records, of other collections, and data already extracted from the collection being processed. The proposed human-in-the-loop approach accelerates the transcription of DC terms by partially automating the extraction of values with a near-human quality. The named-entity recognition model was tested in the extraction of a heterogeneous group of 10 terms, obtaining a recall of 0.859, precision of 0.931, and similarity to the ground-truth data of 0.941, on average.

However, the functional benefits of bipedality in this ecosystem have long been unclear. In this thesis I integrate phylogenetics, functional morphology, biomechanics, information theory, and behavior to investigate whether and how bipedality increases fitness in desert ecosystems, and whether bipedal rodents convergently evolved to have the role in their respective ecosystems.   Based on the diversity of extant dipodid rodents, I begin by statistically reconstructing the pattern of morphological evolution in jerboas. I find that the strongest indicator of bipedality is metatarsal to humerus length, and that changes in this ratio are associated with increased rates of speciation, supporting a punctuated equilibrium pattern of evolution in this clade. Furthermore, the distinct patterns of morphological evolution suggest that a complex suite of genetic and developmental mechanisms governs the acquisition of bipedality in jerboas.   I then use an inverse dynamics approach to characterize the biomechanics of bipedal hopping in a derived jerboa. I find that the dynamics of jerboa hopping are generated predominantly by muscular contractions, rather than tendon-based elastic energy storage and return between strides. Therefore hopping in small rodents favors rapid production and absorption of forces, rather than sustained bouts of steady-state locomotion.   By reviewing predator-prey studies in biomechanics, ecology, and evolution I hypothesize that ricochetal locomotion enhances the ability of small rodents to evade predators that hunt via ballistic interception. I then develop Information Theoretic techniques to measure the unpredictability of escape trajectories in sympatric bipedal and quadrupedal rodents. As expected, bipedal rodents use significantly more unpredictable escape trajectories, likely enhancing predator evasion ability and enabling foraging in exposed areas with higher predation risk. I then found that bipedal rodents exhibit a stronger preference for exploring open spaces, matching previously established foraging patterns. These findings suggest that the evolution of bipedality enables spatial resource partitioning to limit interspecific competition in desert rodents.   Based on the functional studies in my thesis, I evaluate ecological models to predict the occurrence of convergent bipedal rodents in Myomorpha. I show that diet specialization and aridity are insufficient to predict the locomotor morphology of these rodents and develop novel hypotheses for the convergent evolution of bipedalism in desert rodents.   My thesis investigates the functional consequences of morphological evolution in the context of evolutionary ecology. By considering the interconnectedness of ecology, behavior, and evolution, studies in biomechanics can be designed to inform each of these fields. This interdisciplinary approach is necessary to study the adaptive nature of behavioral traits that are governed by myriad genetic, developmental, and environmental factors.",2016,21/1/2020 3:22,20/2/2021 0:00,,,195,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Harvard University,Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1931831306,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\NZNHFBXW\Moore - 2016 - An Integrative Investigation of Convergent Bipedal.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records
KFK4ST98,thesis,2018,"Le, T.S.",A stratified GIS-based model to identify optimal locations for establishing new permanent sample plots for Eucalyptus bosistoana and Eucalyptus globoidea in New Zealand,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/10092/16210,"As part of an effort to develop a forest industry based on durable hardwood eucalypts in New Zealand, the New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative (NZDFI) have considered Eucalyptus bosistoana and Eucalyptus globoidea as two candidate species. There have been 158 permanent sample plots (PSPs) of the two species established in seven trial sites across the two main islands of the country. The network of these PSPs has provided information for the NZDFI's research program, especially for growth and yield modelling for the target species to examine the relationship between trial sites and the species (i.e. site-species matching). However, the existing PSPs do not cover the entire range of environmental conditions in New Zealand, nor do they cover the range of conditions the species are capable of growing in. Hence, the PSP network could be strategically expanded into new areas. This thesis describes a methodology, which combines habitat modelling and stratified random sampling approaches with the capability of geographic information systems (GIS), to build a GIS-based habitat model for a strategic expansion of the current PSP network. The method applied in this study consisted of three main stages. In the first stage, the study selected 17 model variables in three categories (i.e. topography, climate, and soil), defined their importance, and tested them for multicollinearity. For each model variable, data were collected for three geographic zones: (1) the native habitat of the species, (2) all of New Zealand, and (3) the existing PSPs. The second stage was to process data to build the model. The third stage applied variable restriction and stratification analyses to calculate a priority index for the complete study area. This index represented the priority for establishing new PSPs in the study area, based on under-represented environmental characteristics. The result chapter presents available areas for the expansion of the PSP network after the restriction process as the potential habitat for the target species. Besides excluded areas (i.e. not suitable for plantations of E. bosistoana and E. globoidea in the study area), by assessing the priority index in the available areas, the result map highlighted: (1) over-represented areas (i.e. high environmental similarity, where the environmental conditions have been described by many PSPs in the existing network), and (2) under-represented areas (i.e. high environmental dissimilarity, where the environmental conditions have been described by no or few PSPs in the existing network). The results suggest that new PSPs for the two species should be established in Rangitikei District and Taupo District. Other high-priority areas include Northland and Auckland regions, the east coast of the Gisborne region, and southeast-facing hillsides of the mountain chains in the central South Island. Overall, the study built a stratified GIS-based habitat model that successfully determined locations for strategic expansion of the PSP networks of two different species, E. bosistoana and E. globoidea, in New Zealand. With the strengths of GIS and the availability of global GIS data, the methodology in this thesis has high potential to be applied more broadly for different species, different PSP networks, and different study areas.",2018,20/11/2018 23:24,19/2/2021 23:59,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Canterbury,"Christchurch, New Zealand",English,,Masters,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\IEQEEQPZ\Le - 2018 - A stratified GIS-based model to identify optimal l.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

However, marine biodiversity may contain key features for our understanding of global  diversity patterns. Here, I explored this possibility by integrating knowledge about the marine  environment with hypotheses and verbal models used to explain geographic variations in  species diversity. Initially, I used marine productivity data to evaluate the effect of spatial  subsidies on island plant diversity (Chapter 1). This study showed that, contrary to the  proposed hypothesis, there is no evidence that allochthonous resources influence the diversity  of small islands. Subsequently, I realized a conceptual review of the main mechanisms  proposed to explain the latitudinal gradient of speciation under a marine perspective (chapter  2). In this review I show that, unlike the terrestrial system, each mechanism generates  predictions totally different in the oceans. Nevertheless, it is also necessary to recognize and  highlight the limitations that are inherent to marine biodiversity data, especially sample bias.  Therefore, I evaluated here the state of our knowledge about the latitudinal distribution of  different taxonomic groups (Chapter 3). In this study I reveal the existence of a species  absence gradient that is strongly associated with low sampling effort in the tropics. Finally, I  tested through a simulation model the efficiency of the empirical sample effort to accurately  detect diversity patterns generated in a virtual ocean (Chapter 4). The result showed that the  diversity gradient currently observed in the oceans does not differ from what is recorded after  applying the same sampling effort in a simple null model. Therefore, I conclude that marine  biodiversity may, indeed, be of great importance to understand macroecological patterns.  However, there are still some geographic and taxonomic gaps that need to be addressed in  order to explore this knowledge to its full potential.",2019,1/5/2019 6:50,19/2/2021 23:58,1/5/2019 6:50,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Universidade Federal de Goiás,"Goiânia, Brazil",Portugese,,PhD,,,GS 2019,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\R67ERP2L\Domingos - 2019 - Oportunidades e desafios em macroecologia marinha.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

As the climate warms, species current ranges are expected to shift, forcing species to persist through these changes or risk local extinction. Plants that exhibit higher phenotypic plasticity will be better equipped to cope in a changing climate, while those more locally adapted may require translocations to more suitable climates. The altitudinal gradient in the Blue Mountains provides the opportunity to use space for time substitution in climate studies as temperatures are expected to shift up the mountain as the climate warms.    A reciprocal transplant was conducted using seeds sourced from low, mid and high altitude populations of Acacia species restricted to lower (warmer) or higher (cooler) altitudes, as well as, species widespread across the altitudinal gradient. These were planted into low and high altitude common garden sites to capture climates within and beyond their current distributions. The aim was to investigate what factors influence species distribution limits along the gradient and determine if plants are locally adapted to the different altitudes. Three hypotheses were proposed for the study. The first, relating to local adaptation predicted that local is best and that seeds planted into sites similar to their climate of origin will exhibit greater fitness (in terms of growth and survival) than those planted further from their originating climate due to local adaptation. The following two hypothesis addressed distribution limits stating that restricted species will have greater fitness than widespread species in their local climate and planting beyond the species distribution will result in greater fitness losses compared to similar distances within their range limits.    Results showed that seed was able to establish beyond the current distribution limits of species restricted to either low or high altitudes, indicating that dispersal limitation is a greater determinant of species distributions than environmental factors. Plant fitness (seed emergence, seedling growth and survival) was significantly affected by the planting altitude, where greater emergence, seedling growth and survival were seen at low altitude than high altitude sites. A significant GxE interaction revealed seed from low altitudes had greater fitness at low altitude planting sites. Climate (temperature, humidity and rainfall) was a significant determinant of plant fitness, while edaphic and geographic factors had a negligible effect. Plant fitness declined with increasing climate transfer distance in the low altitude planting sites. Despite the temperature gradient in the Blue Mountains, distribution limits in Acacia species may be determined by historic dispersal rather than climate. Local may still be best in the forward (warmer) edge of species distribution, but as climate warms high altitude population may be outperformed by populations originating from lower altitudes. These findings provide a scientific basis for adaptive management strategies, specifically assisted migration under climate change.",2017,18/4/2018 3:28,15/2/2021 4:38,,,89,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Western Sydney University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,M.Res.,,2013166050,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\SXI85TGP\Rolls - 2017 - Species distribution limits and local adaptation i.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Climate Data

The extent to which these records reflect localised vegetation responses to climate fluctuations, and the manner in which people adapted to these changes in climate and vegetation, has yet to be investigated within the context of stratified archaeological inquiry. Analysis of archaeobotanical proxies excavated in association with other cultural remains provide the obvious evidential link to this issue; however, archaeobotany is rarely applied in Australian archaeology due to a lack of application of appropriate field techniques, limited reference collections, and the poor preservation of organic remains. This research, which is part of the ARC Linkage Project: Lifeways of the First Australians, investigates human-environment interaction using archaeobotanical techniques at two sites in the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia: Riwi and Mount Behn rockshelter, during the late Quaternary. Located on the edge of the Great Sandy Desert in Gooniyandi country, Riwi has a discontinuous occupation sequence of about 45 ka, while Mount Behn rockshelter, located some 180 km northwest of Riwi in Bunuba country, has an occupation sequence of ~3 ka. Anthracology (wood charcoal), palynology (pollen and spores), and wood identification using X-ray microtomography are used alongside other research from the Lifeways Project to reconstruct vegetation, investigate humanenvironment interaction, and explore the taphonomy and representativeness of the different proxy data sets.

ZMZ7TI27,thesis,2020,"Kilduff, L.","Spatio-temporal change in species and morphological diversity of reef fishes in the South Pacific Ocean : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Biological Sciences at Massey University, New Zealand",,,,,https://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/15913,"The geography of the South Pacific, with its numerous oceanic islands, offers a unique opportunity to examine prevailing theories on the accumulation and maintenance of biodiversity. It is well recognised that for most taxonomic groups, species richness declines poleward from the equator and eastward across the South Pacific. However, as ocean temperatures warm and oceanographic barriers move with climate change, shifts in the ranges of tropical species towards higher latitudes may lead to changes in community structure and resilience in subtropical locations. Here, I examine the existing biodiversity gradients of reef fishes across the South Pacific Ocean, and identify potentially climate-induced temporal shifts of tropical species into the high latitude and isolated Rangitahua archipelago. Furthermore, I examine morphological changes across latitude and longitude to identify traits associated with species colonisation ability and function within the often species depauperate communities in more isolated and southerly regions of the South Pacific. Additionally, I examine how morphological changes over time might impact the morphological space of the fish community at Rangitahua. I assessed morphological change in 12 standard measurements for 948 fish species, from nine families found on the reefs surrounding 19 of the major island groups of the South Pacific Ocean. I found that while species richness followed the predicted decline towards the east and south, morphological diversity showed the opposite trend, increasing east and south. Furthermore, similar morphological changes were evident with body size and pre-orbit length increasing in response to both latitude and longitude, although more significantly with longitude. Despite this, analysis of individual families revealed unique patterns of morphological change within the South Pacific Ocean, may be indicative of the differing strategies of each family to colonise and persist in more southerly and easterly locations. Within Rangitahua, using a list of 149 shallow Teleost fishes including the dates of their first sighting, I identified a temporal shift in the biogeographic affinities of the fish assemblage with an increasing contribution from tropical regions over time. Newly discovered, more tropical species, only occurred in low numbers, possibly because they are still in the early colonising stage or because the islands environment is still more temperate than these fish require to increase in abundance significantly. Despite also finding that the morphological diversity of the fish assemblage changed through time, morphological change was not directional, indicating that although new species are arriving, their morphology is similar to longer-established, more temperate fishes. Therefore, although the frequency of species with tropical biogeographic affinities is increasing over time at Rangitahua, this is not strongly impacting the community's morphological variation. My results for Rangitahua support the global pattern of tropical species re-distributing towards higher latitude region over time. Overall, my thesis examining both species and morphological change in reef fishes across large-scale geographic gradients within the South Pacific Ocean provides insight into potential future biodiversity changes and may allow us to predict which species are likely, or capable of extending their ranges towards the poles.",2020,22/12/2020 0:44,15/2/2021 4:34,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Massey University,"Palmerston North, New Zealand",English,,M.S.,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\9JQ3Y7Z6\Kilduff - 2020 - Spatio-temporal change in species and morphologica.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

However, plant identification is useful to a broad range of people within society, from conservationists and farmers to citizen scientists. Access to accurate, widely available knowledge about the identity and distribution of living species is critical for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.  Automated plant identification has undergone major advances since 2012 with the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from the emerging field of deep learning. This branch of machine learning has shown remarkable accuracy in image classification and visual object recognition when applied to still images through competitions such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. This research project used transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained deep learning CNNs originally developed for the ImageNet challenge, such as Inception and ResNet, which are publicly available through Tensorflow Hub. The models were applied to the automated identification of images of plants extracted from the Australian National Botanic Gardens Australian Plant Image Index and validated using additional images from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and other Internet sources. A comparison of model performance was undertaken using three different datasets: whole plant images (9,612 images of 392 species with at least 20 images per species), images of flowers (3,384 images of 271 species with at least 10 images per species) and scanning electron microscopy images of liverwort spores from Fossombronia spp. (322 images of 12 species with at least 10 images per species). To decrease the risk of overfitting and extend the training dataset, data augmentation techniques such as scaling and reflection were tested to identify a high performing method, which also improved overall model performance. The best performing model for the All-plants (80.6% accuracy) and Flower datasets (88.4% accuracy) was Inception_V3 pre-trained on the iNaturalist dataset of plants and animals. For the Fossombronia spp. dataset, the best performing model (81.2% accuracy) was ResNet_V2-50 pre-trained on ImageNet 2012, using the 50-layer implementation of ResNet_V2. The best performing flower identification model was also shown to have some proficiency in identifying the genus of an unknown species, where the genus but not species was represented in the dataset, with a Top-5 accuracy of 66%. The Flower dataset's best model performance was further tested using 1,000 images (20 images of 50 randomly selected species) downloaded from the Atlas of Living Australia and the Internet which produced a Top-1 accuracy of 85.9%. Questions that remain to be addressed include further testing of data augmentation approaches and more comprehensive analysis to exclude overfitting. An interesting future extension of this study would be to train the best performing model on a larger dataset of Australian plant images, which could be used to aid scientists and the general public in identifying unknown species through image upload using an online website or phone app.",2019,4/11/2019 0:42,15/2/2021 4:33,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Canberra, ACT, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2019,,10.36334/modsim.2019.a1.boston,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3D2JDI9U\Boston and Dijk - 2019 - Some experiments in automated identification of Au.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Conventional methods like excavation are commonly used to remediate polluted areas, but also cause elevated costs and a significant environmental impact. The interest in phytormemediation, which is the ability of plants to remediate contaminated land, as it has become more popular during recent years. Common reed (Phragmites australis) and Salix sp. were tested in this study to assess the potential for heavy metal uptake by analysis of heavy metal reduction in the soil. The plants were assessed with the purpose to be used within phytoremediation as well as potential source for biofuel. A field study was included in this project at Ekeby wastewater treatment plant in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Three sample points were chosen based on previous environmental studies conducted by Norconsult AB. Soil material contaminated with metals and local populations of Salix sp and common reed were collected for analysis in a pot experiment were differences in metal content in the soil before and after cultivation were investigated. In total 3 shoots of Salix sp and 3 shoots of common reed were cultivated in soil material from each sample point in a greenhouse at Stockholm University. Soil material from each sample point were used as control and were placed in the same greenhouse during the pot experiment. The sampled plants were grown in contaminated soil material for 80 days and regularly irrigated with distilled water. The soil material was analyzed with respect to metals before and after cultivation of the local plants. After the growth period the results did not show any significant differences in the metal content of the soil compared to the control pot. It is assumed that the cause is due to the relatively short cultivation period, the low number of individual plants used and the number of analyzes performed. The  remediation potential for the local plants of Salix sp and common reed could probably be determined in a more suitable way though analysis of metals from the harvested plant material. Salix and common reed are used as biofuel in Sweden, but quality, management and practical limitations affect the yield and the waste that has to be taken care of. Further studies should be carried out to evaluate economic and environmental benefits through implementation of phytoremediation on contaminated land to assess when during the season the plants should be harvested to accumulate the greatest level of contaminants with consideration to the plants as a competitive bio-material. Phytoremediation works and has been demonstrated through several studies. However, a clear organization and knowledge of the local environmental characteristics of the contaminated site are vital features to implement this measure with a good result.",2017,28/2/2018 5:36,6/2/2021 1:39,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden",,not specified,,Masters,,,GS 2017,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\KY78KWN8\Wahl Edman - 2017 - Fytoremediering med Salix sp och bladvass (P. aust.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Exotic plants may change the foraging behavior of pollinators and dynamics of interactions of local assemblages. Due to the lack of shared evolutionary history between exotic plants and native pollinators, it is likely that the morphological and phenological mismatches are especially important in determining the interactions involving exotic plants and specialist native pollinators. In addition, exotic plant species are expected to be pollinated by abundant generalist pollinators whose interactions are phylogenetically constrained compared to specialists pollinators. To evaluate these issues, we compiled 28 plant-pollinator networks with 778 plant species (10% alien) and 3019 pollinator species, comprising 7919 interactions. We expected that: (a) exotic plants tend to be visited by more generalist pollinator species compared to the co-occurring native plant species; (b) an increase in the proportion of exotic plants in the plant-pollinator networks promotesan increase in the global connectivity and nestednessof the interactions. If these predictions are correct, then the introduction of plants should also promote an increase in the risk of heterospecific pollen deposition on native plants. We found that exotic and native plants did not differ in the average degree of specialization of their pollinators. Moreover, an increase in the proportion of alien plants did not affecteither structure or the connectivity of networks. On the other hand, there was an increase in the risk of heterospecific pollen deposition on native plant stigmas when the proportion of exotic plants increases to about 1/3 of the flora pollinated by animals.However, above this percentage the relationship is reversed. This result may be a consequence of progressive decrease in pollinator fidelity of native plants in habitats with low-levels of invasion by exotic species, reducing the amount of shared pollen due to the impoverished pollinator fauna.",2014,28/2/2018 6:09,6/2/2021 1:39,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Universidade Federal de Goiás, Brazil",,not specified,,Masters,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\X3KH69FX\Dissertação - Cristiele Barbosa Valente - 2014.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

As distributions of species shift in response to changes in climate so will management priorities and investment. Species that currently pose a major management issue may cease to be, whereas others that pose little threat at present may become serious pests. To develop cost-effective invasive species management strategies into the future it is necessary to understand how species distributions are likely to change over time and space. For most species, however, few data are available on their current distributions, let alone predicted future distributions. We demonstrate the benefits of Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) for predicting current and future distributions of invasive species when empirical data are lacking. Using the commercially valuable invasive species buffel grass (Pennisetum ciliare [syn.] Cenchrus ciliaris) as an example, we propose a framework by which expert knowledge and available empirical data can be used to build a BBN to predict species distribution under various climate scenarios. BBNs are extremely flexible and can incorporate a range of diverse influential variables, such as soil quality and climate, management variables such as fire and grazing, landscape characteristics such as topography and aspect, and ecological processes such as plant competition. Our framework models the susceptibility and suitability of the Australian continent to buffel grass colonisation using three invasion requirements: the introduction of plant propagules to a site, the establishment of new plants at a site, and the persistence of established, reproducing populations at a site. Our results highlight the potential for buffel grass management to become increasingly important in the southern part of the continent. In the north, conditions are predicted to become less suitable. The overall suitability of hummock grasslands to buffel grass is predicted to decline modestly, while the National Reserve System (NRS) within this biome is predicted to increase in suitability. Our modelling suggests that overall the risk of buffel grass colonisation, establishment and persistence within the NRS is likely to increase with climate change as a result of the high number of small reserves located in the central and southern portion of the continent. Due to the value of buffel grass for pasture, attitudes towards its costs and benefits are polarised which hampers efforts to develop policy for its sustainable management. Our results suggest that climate change will not diminish the issue of how to manage this invasive species. Indeed, the need to develop sustainable management policy in response to predicted shifts in spatial distribution of invasive species and subsequent threats to national assets has never been greater. We find BBNs to be an effective and inexpensive tool to predict species spatial distributions where resources are limited.",2012,28/2/2018 5:37,24/3/2023 0:50,,,,,,NA,,Invasive species and climate change: a framework for predicting species distribution when data are scarce,,NA,NA,Invasive species and climate change: a framework for predicting species distribution when data are scarce,CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship,"Queensland, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2012,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\7LR4B3SC\Martin, TG et al. - 2012 - Invasive species and climate change a framework f.pdf",,2 - ALA cited
RVGUISZB,conferencePaper,2019,"Kearney, N.",It's Not Always FAIR: Choosing the Best Platform for Your Biodiversity Heritage Literature,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,,,10.3897/biss.3.35493,https://biss.pensoft.net/article/35493/,"The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is a global consortium of over 460 contributors who have specifically chosen the BHL as the online platform to host their digitised biodiversity heritage literature. In 2018, staff from BHL Australia (a project funded by the Atlas of Living Australia and hosted by Museums Victoria) travelled across the Tasman Sea to work with the Auckland War Memorial Museum (Tamaki Paenga Hira) to start a new branch of the BHL - BHL New Zealand. The Auckland War Memorial Museum has a novel approach when it comes to its own online content. They believe that the best way to amplify their collections is not via their own website, but via external collaborations. Acknowledging that their own website cannot best serve the many different types of content they curate and create, they seek the external platforms that can - platforms that have the specific functionality required to make each type of content findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and that will reach and impact the greatest audience. When the Auckland Museum was seeking the best platform for their biodiversity heritage literature, they were attracted by the BHL's functionality (such as Full Text Search, Optical Character Recognition and Global Names Recognition and Discovery); the extended discoverability and interoperability enabled via the BHL's partnerships (such as with the Encyclopedia of Life, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and the Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities); and BHL's massive audience. However, the BHL is not the only platform hosting biodiversity heritage literature. Commercial publishers are rapidly uploading the back issues of the journals they host. There are now thousands of out-of-copyright journal articles on websites such as Wiley Online Library and Taylor &amp; Francis Online. Historic literature is not the primary focus for these publishers, but the functionality they provide for journal articles has brought the historic publications they host into the modern linked network of scholarly research. Every article on their websites, whether it was published 200 years ago or today, receives a Digital Object Identifier (a DOI). A DOI is a unique permanent identifier assigned to a piece of online content (usually) at the time of its publication - a persistent link that should be included in every citation of that piece of content. In an ideal world, the DOI system would enable readers to link from article to article in a never-ending trail of knowledge. However, a significant proportion of our historic literature still sits outside this linked network, representing dead ends (or at least annoying setbacks) in the quest for information. The other invaluable benefit of DOIs is that they provide citation metrics, allowing authors, publishers and institutions to track the use and impact of their publications. The historic literature is the foundation upon which our understanding of biodiversity is based.

Part Separating algorithm (PS) feature extraction integrated into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier could not demonstrate general results. The performance of SVM combined with PS was high only in Family Sphingdae of Order Lepidoptera but its accuracy rate may be dropped when used for classifying in other families. Therefore, this paper applied Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) having PS as the feature extraction process for AII for the butterfly family identification of Order Lepidoptera. In the pattern recognition process of image processing, the recognition ability of ELM classification with various activation functions and SVM were also investigated and compared. The experimental results showed that the classification in ELM using five insect features via the PS algorithm can be improved the as well as the ability to generalize every butterfly family of ELM performance, showing higher recognition rates than the SVM method in every family of order Lepidoptera.",2014,28/2/2018 5:36,6/2/2021 1:00,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Kitakyushu, Japan",not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,10.12792/icisip2014.049,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QN8WP9X6\385-1744-1-PB.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Haw.) is a stem-succulent, perennial herb in the Apocynaceae family. Native to South Africa and widely cultivated as a hardy, 'lowcare' ornamental plant; it has naturalised in semi-arid and arid parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland. In South Australia, concerns were raised regarding the invasive potential and impact of carrion flower after it invaded chenopod and saltbush/bluebush vegetation communities. The species was found to limit the growth of Atriplex vesicaria Heward ex Benth. by reducing water availability. Biomass of annual plants and the number of seedlings that germinated under A. vesicaria were also reduced. In 2010, carrion flower was detected in north-western New South Wales (NSW) in the Gilgais region of Pilliga National Park. The known extent of the infestation is approximately 35 ha. Upon discovering the infestation, a NSW Weed Risk Assessment was performed to ascertain potential risk. This assessment confirmed that carrion flower is a 'very high risk' weed. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) immediately treated the weed to prevent further spread. This initial herbicide treatment was mostly ineffective. Subsequently, foliar application of four herbicide formulations was trialled in situ to determine: i) efficacy of carrion flower control; and 2) any non-target damage to native plant species. Monitoring plots were established and sampled before and after herbicide application. Interim results showed that Garlon 600 and Starane(R) Advanced achieved 100 and 98% mortality of the plant respectively. As yet, negligible impacts on non-target native species have been detected. Although, given some of the herbicides may have active residuals in the soil, ongoing monitoring will be necessary. Once a suitable herbicide is identified and the full extent of the infestation is adequately delimited, an eradication program for carrion flower in Pilliga National Park will be considered.",2013,28/2/2018 5:36,3/3/2023 1:53,,133-136,,,,NA,,,Proceedings of the 17th …,NA,NA,,The Weed Society of NSW  Inc.,"Corowa, NSW, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2013,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\I2SGMXB9\Hamilton et al. - 2013 - Carrion flower, a novel invasive species in NSW.pdf",,2 - ALA cited

It reproduces by seed and by root suckers and can form monocultures displacing desirable native shrubs and trees. Very little published information is available regarding suitable control methods and anecdotal reports of the effectiveness of herbicides are variable. We conducted two trials to determine the effectiveness of herbicides to control desert ash. From the first screening trial picloram and triclopyr + picloram were excluded, and the herbicides glyphosate, glyphosate + metsulfuron-methyl, metsulfuronmethyl alone at two rates and triclopyr ester were tested further. Approximately 150 trees were used in a second trial with herbicide treatments applied using the cut and paint method. Glyphosate was the best performing herbicide, with no healthy regrowth arising from stumps at the end of the trial, 35 months after treatment (MAT). Triclopyr ester also performed well with regrowth from 6% of treated stumps. The number of stumps with regrowth for the two metsulfuronmethyl treatments and the metsulfuron + glyphosate mix increased over the three year period of the trial, while the number of stumps with regrowth reduced for the glyphosate and triclopyr-treated stumps. Trials are underway to determine the effect of herbicide application method (cut stump, stem injection) and time of application (winter, summer, autumn) on desert ash control.",2014,28/2/2018 6:03,3/3/2023 1:57,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Council of Australasiona Weed Societies,"Hobart, Tasmania, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3RN4SBAA\Dugdale et al. - 2014 - Controlling desert ash (Fraxinus angustifolia subs.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

The success of AVH ultimately led to funding for the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and in October 2012 AVH was re-launched as part of the ALA infrastructure (http://avh.chah.org.au). Since 2012, some university herbaria have also joined AVH and in June 2017 the New Zealand Virtual Herbarium (NZVH) was integrated, giving rise to the Australasian Virtual Herbarium. The AVH currently holds almost 6.3 million records from 23 Australian and New Zealand herbaria and comprises over 80 per cent of the vouchered occurrence records of Australian plants, algae and fungi in ALA. While no longer at the forefront of the digitisation wave, having been around for so long, AVH can provide valuable insights into how and to what extent herbarium data is used and into the benefits of digitisation for herbaria and natural history collections. Six years of download statistics shows an ever-increasing use of AVH data and a widening of the user base. A far greater proportion of downloaded records is ostensibly used for new uses like ecological research and conservation, than for the traditional uses of herbarium specimen data, systematics and collections management. The last few years have also seen an increase in the use of AVH data in education. Over the years many research articles based on AVH data have been written, mostly at the interface between ecology and systematics, i.e. biogeography and conservation science. With the increase of the types of uses for herbarium data, it becomes important, also for the herbaria themselves, to consider the fitness for purpose of AVH data for uses other than the purpose for which it was collected. It has become apparent that the uncertainty of the latitudes and longitude provided with herbarium specimens is often too great for use in ecological research or conservation and there is a bias in collection density at the bioregion level, which is likely to be more severe at smaller spatial scales. Also, while the demand for vouchered occurrence records is increasing, we have seen a steady decrease in the intake of new specimens by Australian herbaria since the 1980s. This presentation will cover how Australian herbaria use AVH, how other users use AVH and what being part of AVH has meant to Australian herbaria.",2018,26/6/2018 0:33,2/2/2021 8:30,,e25866,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.25866,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\Y8PVP26D\Klazenga - 2018 - The Australasian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) and the C.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed

Improvements to data timeliness can be made by integrating directly with national and international biodiversity repositories, such as the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). I will present two Citizen Science apps that we developed for the conservation of two of Australia's iconic species - the koala and the echidna. First is the Koala Counter app used in the Great Koala Count 2 - a two-day Blitz-style population census. The aim was to improve both the recording of citizen science effort as well as to improve the recording of ""absence"" data which would improve population modelling. Our solution was to increase the transparent use of the phone sensors as well as providing an easy-to-use user interface.

The increasing number of national nodes deploying this free and open source software platform has built a worldwide community involving more than 17 countries, that collaborate openly in a decentralized way (https://living-atlases.gbif.org/), helping each other out by organizing technical workshops and by developing and sharing new software modules using GitHub. One of these modules in the Living Atlases infrastructure is an R package called ALA4R originally created by Ben Raymond (https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ALA4R). It provides the research community with programmatic data access to many of the Living Atlases data services using R.

In the Natural Sciences department, CARP has funded the equivalent of five positions over five collecting areas for four years. These are filled by six part-time collection technicians and a senior full-time manager. As Collection Technicians, our role, across Botany, Entomology, Geology, Marine, and Palaeontology, is to digitise acquisitions prior to December 2012. We are processing the backlogs of our collections, which are prioritised across all museum activities in distinct taxonomic projects. The cataloguing method involves gathering and verifying all available information and entering data into Vernon, our collections management system (https://vernonsystems.com/products/vernon-cms/), with specifically designed record standards aligned to Darwin Core (Wieczorek et al. 2012). CARP has allowed us the freedom to explore backlog collections, some of which have not been fully processed, revealing mysteries that would otherwise have sat undiscovered, and to resolve uncertainties across the collections. For example, in Botany, cataloguing the foreign ferns reveals previously unrealised type specimens; in Marine, cataloguing all 9117 specimen lots of the New Zealand Bivalvia collection, brought classification and locality data uncertainties to resolution. There are multiple projects running concurrently in each collecting area, continually enriching our collection data. In turn, this is opening up a far wider range of information to the public through our online collection portal, AWMM Collections Online http://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections-online (currently 800,000 records). Open accessibility promotes careful consideration of how and what data we deliver, as it is disseminated through global portals, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). Collections that have often had no more attention than recording of their original labels, have interesting stories beyond ""just"" cataloguing them. As cataloguers, we have found that the uncertainties or sometimes apparent lack of detail increases our engagement with our collections. Rather than solely copying information into the database, we become detectives, resolving uncertainties and verifying the background of our objects, collection sites and collectors. This engagement and the global reach of our data mean that we are invested in the programme, so that data entry continuity and accuracy are maximised. Our presentation will give an overview of the CARP and our method, and a look at our progress two years in, highlighting some of our discoveries and how the uncertainty in our data allows us to engage more with our collections.",2018,26/6/2018 0:30,14/1/2021 11:58,,e25194,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.25194,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\JED4YKTS\Schlumpf et al. - 2018 - Data Detectives - The Backlog Cataloguing Project .pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Initial investments of equipment, funding for salaries and development of protocols, led by the Journal Storage (JSTOR) Global Plants Initiative (GPI), with generous support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and Atlas of Living Australia, provided the framework for the generation of digital images of type specimens. Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria administered the project in Australia. Subsequent digitisation initiatives have reflected institutional priorities and resource allocations. The Managers of Australasian Herbaria (MAHC) group has served as a significant resource for exchange of curation expertise and development of standards for digitisation initiatives including provision of the best-practice guidelines for imaging of algae, bryophyte, fungi and lichen specimens. Three initiatives underway in Australasian herbaria have built upon these initial investments in digitisation infrastructure to curate and share digital images in innovative ways. The projects include: digitisation of cryptogram specimens at the Auckland War Memorial Museum Herbarium (AK); generation of exemplar images (including leaves, fruits, seedlings etc.) to support VicFlora the online Flora of Victoria at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL); and development of the infrastructure for delivery of high resolution images and collection data in an online data portal at the University of Melbourne Herbarium (MELU). An overview of these projects enables consideration of the efficiencies gained by collaborative development and sharing of curation protocols among state and national institutions as a result of the diversity of expertise and resources that these collaborative initiatives potentially draw from. In each of these projects, standard workflows were optimised to meet the individual institutional requirements. The innovative approaches that were taken that suited the unique aspects of our diverse collections will be discussed. Finally, these projects provided insights into some challenges frequently encountered and potential solutions to the challenge of curating large numbers of digital images, including maintenance of accurate links between actual and digital collection objects, for large and small natural history collections.",2018,26/6/2018 0:22,14/1/2021 11:58,,e26077,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.26077,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\R3I2PKUZ\Ranatunga et al. - 2018 - Digitise This!

Over the last nine decades more than 4000 plant specimens from the area have been collected by around 212 botanists, most associated with the Australian National Herbarium, and tens of thousands of insect specimens by at least 184 entomologists, most associated with the Australian National Insect Collection. These collections have resulted in the area being the type locality for at least 197 species (2 lichens, 10 flowering plants, and the rest invertebrates). The first research reports relating to the area were published in the 1950s. Since then over 130 papers, theses or other reports have been written, more than half published since 1990. Just over half the papers relate to faunal studies, 31% to flora and vegetation, 11% to the physical environment and the rest to fire ecology. Around 80% of papers were by scientists from ANU, the University of Canberra and Commonwealth research institutions. ACT Government scientists commenced research and monitoring in the area in the mid-1970s, their work mostly relating to vegetation, vertebrate fauna and monitoring the impacts of management burns. Citizen science documenting the area's biodiversity has been prominent since the 1960s and includes the activities of community groups and many individuals. The collective efforts of professional and citizen scientists have resulted in Black Mountain's biota probably being more comprehensively studied and documented that any other area of comparable size in the ACT. This reflects a combination of key collecting and research institutions being located on Black Mountain's footslopes and its accessibility to local citizens.

This has thrust natural history museums and especially the biodiversity specimen collections they hold into the forefront of biodiversity research in systematics, ecology, and conservation, underscoring their central role in the modern scientific enterprise. The advent of such digitization and data mobilization initiatives as the United States National Science Foundation's Advancing the Digitization of Biodiversity Collections program (ADBC), Australia's Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), Mexico's National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO), Brazil's Centro de Referencia em Informacao (CRIA), Europe's SYNTHESYS, and China's National Specimen Information Infrastructure (NSII) has led to a rapid rise in regional, national, and international digital data aggregators and has precipitated an exponential increase in the availability of digital data for scientific research. The international Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) now serves about 130 million museum specimen records, and Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), the U.S. national biodiversity portal, has amassed over 109 million records representing over 300 million specimens that are international in scope. These digital resources raise the profiles of museums, expose collections to a wider audience of systematic and conservation researchers, provide the best biodiversity data in the modern era outside of nature itself, and ensure that specimen-based research remains at the forefront of the biodiversity sciences. Here we provide a brief overview of worldwide digital data generation and mobilization, the impact of these data on biodiversity research, new data underscoring the impact of worldwide digitization initiatives on citation in scientific publications, and evidence of the roles these activities play in raising the public and scientific profiles of natural history collections.",2018,9/8/2018 1:31,14/1/2021 11:54,,e28470,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.28470,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QEY5UXRE\Nelson and Ellis - 2018 - The Impact of Digitization and Digital Data Mobili.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

In addition, DoEE is working with 7 state and territory environment departments to implement a common assessment method (CAM) for the assessment and listing of nationally threatened species. The method is based on the IUCN Red List criteria. Each Australian jurisdiction has traditionally used different assessment method, including categories, criteria, thresholds, definitions and scales of assessment to list threatened species within their jurisdiction. The CAM is a standardised method for species assessed for listing at the national level. Through cross-jurisdictional collaboration, this will improve the efficiency of the assessment process and facilitate consistency across jurisdictional lists. The BCCVL includes linkages to species observations on the ALA and users are able to add their own data including contextual and species data. The project aims to create a secure environment where cross-jurisdictional collaboration can occur both on the standardisation of methodologies for creating species distributions and the integration of data. The project also aims to provide a secure platform for jurisdictions to contribute sensitive observations not available through the ALA and take into consideration expert feedback on the distribution of species. The project will provide a public-facing platform whereby SDM's can be published. This will be searchable by area, species or contributor.

GSQFG2RG,conferencePaper,2018,"Kearney, N.",What are we DOIng about the Missing Links? Connecting Taxonomic Names to the Linked Network of Scholarly Research,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,,,10.3897/biss.2.25700,https://biss.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=25700,"The classification of living things depends upon the literature. Access to this literature is essential to taxonomic research and to our understanding of biodiversity. There have been tremendous efforts to digitise the world's biodiversity literature; the Biodiveristy Heritage Library (BHL) alone has uploaded over 54 million pages, all of which is freely accessible online. Our scientific literature is far more accessible than it has ever been, but that does not mean it is easily discoverable. Much of the taxonomic literature online remains outside the linked network of scholarly research. But that is rapidly changing. Taxonomic aggregators are an invaluable source of authoritative information on species names and their hierarchical classification. It is critical that this information includes citations for taxonomic descriptions, that these citations link to the published literature online and that (wherever possible) the citations include DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers). The DOI is an essential part of a publication's bibliographic metadata and should be included (as a live link) in any reference to that content. However, the definitive (DOI'd) versions of recent publications are frequently behind paywalls. And, while much of the historic literature available online is open access, commercial publishers are uploading out-of-copyright publications onto their own websites, assigning DOIs to ""their"" definitive versions (the versions that must be cited in other publications, as per DOI requirements) and then locking the defintiive versions behind paywalls. This is perfectly within their rights. DOIs may be assigned to legacy publications retrospectively, providing that: a) the party assigning them owns the rights for the content, or has permission from the rights holder to assign a DOI, and b) the publication does not already have a DOI. If there are no rights attached to a piece of content, anyone can assign a DOI to it. This means that citation traffic from the bibliographies of current publications is increasingly directed towards commercial publishers' websites, rather than towards open access versions, such as those freely available on the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). However, taxonomic aggregators are not bound by the same obligations as publishers and may therefore choose to link to any online version of a publication (although the DOI should still be included in the citation). Many taxonomic aggregators link to the literature available on BHL. The taxonomic name profiles in EOL (Encyclopedia of Life), GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and ALA (Atlas of Living Australia) each contain a BHL bibliography: a list of links to the pages in BHL that contain an identified mention of that taxon name. However, the lists of returned results can be long, and they may or may not include the citations for accepted names, synonyms and taxon concepts. Some biodiversity aggregators feature these key citations on the names pages (or tabs) of taxon profiles. However, where these do exist, they are usually plain text rather than links. BHL is now registering DOIs for the content it hosts and is creating landing pages for articles, containing the full bibliographic metadata, including (where applicable) the DOI. Articles are now discoverable by article title, keywords within titles (scientific names, locations, traits, etc.), author names and DOIs, and can be easily linked to (via their landing pages) by other parties. This paper will examine the issues, benefits and complexities associated with linking to definitive versions, the difference between easy and open access, the ethics of putting out-of-copyright content behind paywalls, and the future of creating order amongst the massively expanding resource of literature online.",2018,5/6/2018 4:22,14/1/2021 11:46,,e25700,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.25700,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\BYVU4B43\Kearney - 2018 - What are we DOIng about the Missing Links Connect.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

It was formed in 2009 based initially on Australian herbaria, and later incorporated New Zealand herbaria. MAHC currently has 18 member institutions representing both government funded, and university based herbaria, and includes both the largest (National Herbarium of Victoria - MEL) and smallest collections (Macquarie University - MQU) in the region. The group meets in person annually, and holds regular conference phone calls throughout the year. MAHC has proved itself to be a very cohesive committee, despite time, sizing, staffing, and funding differences. It prides itself in being inclusive, cooperative, collegiate, collaborative and supportive. It has a strong mentor approach toward early career collections managers or those new to collections management. The group has a healthy forward planning outlook, developing, promoting and implementing collections management policy, recommendations, guidelines and standards. This cohesion has resulted in a toolkit of resources that are freely available and strives for a unified world class best practice herbarium curation. Some of these universally agreed tools include templates, biosecurity documents, disaster mitigation and preparation for Nagoya Protocol implementation for Australia and New Zealand. MAHC supports new international initiatives and manages the day to day running of programmes such as the Global Plants Initiative project imaging all vascular type specimens housed in Australasia.

One hundred and seventeen species were recorded from 1980 to 2005 and 75 species from 2006 to the end of 2016. The 30 most frequently observed species were similar in both time periods, although the frequency rank of some species changed, with the rank of four species dropping by >5 places and that of at least five species increasing by >5 places. Twenty-nine species have not been recorded in the area since 2006 and include two vulnerable species (Hooded Robin and Brown Tree-creeper). Records of breeding activity in the periods 1982-2006 and 2007-2016 indicated the Australian Raven and Gang-gang Cockatoo had substantially increased breeding activity in the latter period, while that of the Australian Magpie and Magpie-lark had reduced. While increased human use of the area and management activities such as control burns could explain some of the above changes, the causes of most changes are not known and probably reflect human-induced effects in the wider Canberra area.

This is largely due to the steadily declining mass, size and costs of sensors, continuously opening new opportunities to monitor new species. While previously 'tracking data'-data from spatially enabled sensors such as GPS sensors-was most prominent, currently almost 70% of all bio-logging data is comprised of non-spatial data as e.g., physiological data. In contrast to the biodiversity data community, where standards to mobilize and exchange data are relatively well established, the bio-logging community is still lacking standards to transport data from sensors into repositories, or to mobilize data in a standardized format from different repositories to enable cooperation between users, shared software tools, data aggregation for meta-analysis, or a consistent format for long-term archiving. To set the stage for a discussion about standards for bio-logging data to be developed or adapted, we present a mind map describing the different pathways of bio-logging data during its life cycle, and the opportunities for standardization within this cycle. As an example we present the use of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 'SensorML' and 'Observations &amp; Measurements' standards to transfer bio-logging data from a sensor to a repository and ultimately to a user for subsequent analysis. These standards provide machine-readable methods for describing bio-logging sensors and the measurements they collect, offering a standardized structure that can be customized by the bio-logging community (e.g. with standardized vocabularies) to achieve interoperability.",2018,5/6/2018 4:33,14/1/2021 11:34,,e25914,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.25914,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\6XF3RHFN\Dettki et al. - 2018 - Setting the Stage – The Life Cycle of Bio-logging .pdf,,ALA author

Most species are independent of free-standing water except for breeding where all species have aquatic egg deposition and a conventional tadpole as the larval stage. The fauna is derived from two sources: taxa related to frog genera found across i) tropical, northern Australia and ii) genera from temperate, southern and eastern Australian. Those derivations are both recent - with some ongoing tenuous connections to tropical in north-west coastal areas, and ancient, reflecting the long term drying trend in arid Australia over the last 20 million years. Burrowing species can form waterproof cocoons, but also survive in moist soils. Most can reduce metabolic rates and ingest high quality foods in sufficient quantities in very short time frames to allow survival underground for many years between major rain events, and to allow them to be super abundant.

Twelve months on, the project has reached a state of stable production readiness, having met all of the initial objectives of the Functional Requirements for use in the ALA Portal. The development team has built two main open source components. The first, code-named Danno, is a Java based annotation server that implements the W3C Annotea public Draft Protocols [2], and the Open Archives Initiative Protocols for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) [3]. Users may interact with the server using the browser-independent client-side user interface components developed in parallel with Danno which we have named Dannotate, or through existing, browser-specific Annotea clients such as Annozilla [4]. Together, Danno and Dannotate form a comprehensive HTTP based annotation service for Internet or intranet content. The granularity of annotations and associated reply chains may be a full HTML page, selected areas of text on a page, and/or selected regions of images on the pages, or images served stand-alone. In this paper we describe the major technical design challenges and decisions made, highlighting the implications of some of these choices as they apply to users and administrators of the ALA, or any other systems that elect to utilize the Danno and/or Dannotate components to provide annotation services.",2009,16/5/2018 23:59,22/2/2023 3:35,,6,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Montpellier, France",English,,,,,GS 2009,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\RVJEX2T9\Chernich et al. - An Open Source Annotation Service for the Atlas of.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed

SpongeMaps hosts and displays data from individual sponge specimens, mandatorily stored and accessible in a public collection, in the following formats: • precise and current taxonomic data, with hyperlinks, based on the authoritative resources of the World Porifera Database and the Australian Faunal Directory; • morphological observations of specimens (and species) as MSExcel (or CSV) documents; • photographs, including underwater (live), deck, SEM and micrographs as low resolution jpegs for web-display (with the capacity to store high resolution images in an access-restricted area); • precise collection data for specimens (including depth, longitude and latitude); • DNA sequence data, directly deposited into SpongeMaps as FASTA files, or harvested from the Sponge Barcoding Database (www.spongebarcoding.org) and/or GenBank; • chemical datasets, including specific information about chemical compounds isolated from individual sponges, such as molecular formulae (stored as SMILES codes) • bibliographic records, including PDFs of unrestricted documents. Centralising the storage of all these data sources for individual specimens, allows researchers to access information from a one-stop portal. Additional sources of data, such as DNA sequence alignment files or phylogenetic character matrices, may be added in future releases of SpongeMaps, depending on demand. Primarily, however, SpongeMaps enables researchers to collaborate on any specimen of sponge, comparing to other species and specimens elsewhere, in real time. Using SpongeMaps, anyone can obtain an integrated insight into known species of sponges (currently confined to the Indo-West Pacific fauna), through the public portal. Through the member-only area, sponge researchers can work together with confidence in the security of their data to collaborate on understanding the biodiversity of sponges in the Indo-West Pacific region, moving taxa through the pipeline from specimens, through OTU concepts, to defined species.",2013,28/2/2018 5:36,12/1/2021 6:20,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Fremantle, WA, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2013,,10.13140/2.1.3258.3682,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\SHYIJL5C\Hall et al. - 2013 - SpongeMaps an online collaborative tool for taxon.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Crowdsourcing has emerged as a solution with the possibilities of utilizing intellectual resources of the mass for scientific purposes. In this study, the possibility of conducting transcription of primary biodiversity data using crowdsourcing has been explored. A crowdsourcing application for transcribing image labels from biological specimens was implemented and the accuracy of transcription from citizen scientists was assessed. The consensus among the users' inputs was computed using Multiple Sequence Algorithms and then evaluated against the ground truth. The results demonstrated a mixed level of accuracy for different input fields in transcription. It indicates that the level of accuracy in transcriptions depends on the level of interpretation required from the participants.

The work exhibited is a small installation consisting of a large wall image and an elliptical table containing contemporary jewellery objects designed to invite the viewer to look closely at works that signify sensory experience and to convey knowledge of plants and place. The pieces include seven brooches, a ring and a neckpiece. A number of these are carved from a material I first developed to represent the texture of a plant. These are made from hundreds of layers of coloured tissue paper, the by-product of which is dyed archival glue - a new material. The neckpiece is made from silver and copper wirework. The Research Paper is about ways in which we come to know place. To set structure for the research I adopted the observations of poetry anthologist Brian Elliot, in particular as to how poets come to terms with the Australian landscape. In turn, my investigations at Trenerry Reserve involved the exploration of a coastal wetland, where I recorded the sensory experience of being there and how that landscape has changed over time. An essential part of my research was an investigation of the ecology of the wetland, how people have interacted with it, and in what way they have valued that place and the surrounding environment. By looking largely and closely, I have responded to Trenerry Reserve not only by creating jewellery objects but also by writing about what I have learned in the context of the accounts of others who have come to know places in the landscape more deeply. The works of three established contemporary jewellery artists who have place-related artpractices are also discussed in terms of jewellery communicating moments noticed, the things they are passionate about. Underlying this exploration is the concept of 'collection', a theme that resonates with each of the artists, and one that has played a role in my art practice.",2014,28/2/2018 6:04,14/3/2023 23:54,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Sydney,,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\YJQCLSNZ\jakobsson_ka_thesis.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

CYFWTKFW,thesis,2014,"Garms, Brian W.",Native Insects as a Framework for Understanding Potential Impacts of Exotic Species,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1994437653?accountid=26957,"The problem of managing exotic species in new habitats is large and complex. Many different working theories have been developed to attempt to understand and predict impacts of exotic species in new environments, either as unintentional introductions or as intentional introductions such as biological control agents. Invariably such theories have had mixed support and there is no single theoretical framework for accurate predictions of the impact (either positive or negative) of exotic species. Nevertheless, development of theory is an active area of research as predictions of future impacts of exotic species are critical for directing resources to best maintain ecosystems of value to humans.    This thesis looks to develop new experimental approaches for understanding and predicting potential exotic species impacts. Native species are demonstrated to be an effective tool for experimentally determining both what type of exotic species impacts are possible and the minimum biological parameters an exotic must have to generate these impacts. Three systems are investigated to demonstrate the application of this approach in multiple systems.    In Chapter 2 Scirtothrips aurantii is investigated as an invasive species and potential future pest in Australia. This recent invader has not attacked many potential host plants in Australia despite doing so in its native range. The results of this chapter show that the biology of this insect and its host selection behaviour suggest it could become a pest in the future. However the results also highlight the limitations of a study focussing on the invasive species alone, and how such findings need to be placed into a local context, in this case with native Australian Scirtothrips species.    In Chapters 3 and 4 the impact of the native magpie moth (Nyctemera amica) on invasive fireweed (Senecio madagascariensis) is studied. In Chapter 3 the biology and host selection behaviour of the moth show that fireweed is a suitable host, but moth host preferences vary based on their local population and may point to changing utilization of fireweed over time. In Chapter 4 herbivory by magpie moth larvae is shown to reduce the fitness of fireweed in the lab and the field. These findings are counter to the predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) and the implications for selection of biological control agents of fireweed are discussed.    In Chapters 5, 6 and 7 the biology of the horehound bug (Agonoscelis rutila) and its impacts on horehound (Marrubium vulgare) are investigated. In Chapter 5 horehound bug adults and juveniles are shown to feed on seeds. In Chapter 6 the potential of the horehound bug to pollinate horehound is investigated. The insect does not provide any pollination services; its effect on horehound seed set is strictly negative. However, significant variation in between-plant pollination rates is documented. Finally, in Chapter 7 the survival of horehound nymphs and their reduction of horehound seed survival in the field are studied, and the implications for ERH and biological control are discussed.",2014,21/1/2020 3:22,12/1/2021 6:02,,,294,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1994437653,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QKIQZL75\Garms - 2014 - Native Insects as a Framework for Understanding Po.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

V5YKMTRS,thesis,2014,"Arias-Penna, Diana Carolina","Taxonomy, phylogeny and resource use of Glyptapanteles (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Microgastrinae), genus highly diversified in the neotropics",,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1704792999?accountid=26957,"Among hymenopteran parasitoid wasps, Ichneumonoidea is one of the superfamilies with the highest number of species and includes the highly diverse Microgastrinae subfamily. Microgastrinae wasps are very abundant and can be collected in many different terrestrial habitats. A considerable number of species have been used in successful biological pest control programs, making it one of the most important insect groups. Glyptapanteles is one of the larger genera within Microgastrinae, which was segregated after several attempts to subdivide the gigantic genus Apanteles Foerster 1862. To date, 122 species have been described worldwide, of which only six are Neotropical, despite unpublished evidence that this genus is one of the largest in the Neotropics. Glyptapanteles are diminutive parasitoid wasps, which are free-living as adults, but as immatures, they attack exclusively larvae of Lepidoptera as a food resource for their developing larvae. These parasitoid wasps play a preponderant role in regulating their lepidopteran host populations and in maintaining high biological diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. A reliable revision for the Neotropics has not yet been attempted and many Glyptapanteles species remain undescribed. The scarcity of both taxon sampling and biological information is no longer standard for some Neotropical groups of insects. In the case of Glyptapanteles, the increasing accumulation of information, during the last four decades, derives from two independent long-term rearing projects: the caterpillar and parasitoid inventory of the Area de Conservacion en Guanacaste (ACG) in Northwestern Costa Rica and the project Caterpillars and Parasitoids of the Eastern Andes (CAPEA) in Ecuador. This massive microgastrine material is available in Dr. James Whitfield's laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and was the fundamental for my research.    Chapter 1 is focused on the first taxonomic revision of Neotropical  Glyptapanteles species from Costa Rica and Ecuador. Here, I describe 137 new species, 78 from Costa Rica and 59 from Ecuador. The taxonomic revision includes an extensive morphological image library for each of the species described and consists of about 2,331 high-resolution images which were used to create 223 plates. The pictures were obtained by both scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Z-stacked images merging different focus positions. The reference collection for this study comprises a total of 16,663 specimens, of which 13,540 are preserved in 100% ethanol and 3,123 are point mounted. Most of the species described (91 spp.) are completely gregarious while 28 are exclusively solitary, nine species exhibited both solitary and gregarious lifestyles and the remaining nine species were collected by Malaise traps. Three different sets of data (morphology, host records and DNA barcoding) were integrated in order to generate accurate boundaries between species.    In Chapter 2, the first Glyptapanteles phylogeny based on morphological and molecular data from fragments of four genes is presented. The genes include mitochondrial COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) and three nuclear genes: Alpha-spectrin; long-wavelength opsin (LW Rh) and wg (wingless). All the Costa Rican material had associated COI, sequences generated partly by the collaborators in the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph, Canada and partly by the Keck Center, UIUC. In contrast, COI sequences for Ecuador material and all nuclear genes were generated at UIUC. Phylogeny estimation included maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The most well supported phylogenetic reconstruction revealed two discrete clades, and although support was low at basal nodes, relationships at intermediate and terminal nodes were resolved with high support. The majority of the parasitoid samples are endowed with information about their herbivore hosts as well as host plants, providing information across three trophic levels. Mapping this information onto the phylogeny revealed patterns of niche conservatism in one of the clades. It was revealed that host preferences of Glyptapanteles are concentrated primarily in exposed feeding Macrolepidoptera, although ancestrally they explored Microlepidoptera.",2014,21/1/2020 3:22,15/3/2022 1:47,,,575,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1704792999,ProQuest,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DPCWV3UZ\Arias-Penna - 2014 - Taxonomy, phylogeny and resource use of Glyptapant.pdf",,5 - ALA mentioned; Animals
GL58BIKC,thesis,2014,"Ahmad, A.",Stemphylium grey leaf spot disease of lupins in Western Australia,,,,,http://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/files/3407362/Ahmad_Arbab_2014.pdf,"One of the traditional principles of disease management is avoidance of the pathogen. This study was planned to investigate the parameters that could be used to develop strategies for avoiding Stemphylium grey leaf spot (GLS) disease of narrow-leafed lupins (NLL) in Western Australia (WA). To achieve this objective, the project was divided into four different components. Firstly, surveys of WA lupin growing regions were carried out over three years to ascertain the presence and distribution of virulent strains of the pathogen in the field. Secondly, the impact of virulent strains of the pathogen on grain yield of NLL was assessed. These two components were planned to investigate the importance of the disease to the Western Australian NLL crop in terms of distribution and potential impact on production. The third component focused on the environmental requirements of the disease. Temperature and moisture requirements for optimum growth of the pathogen and for establishment of infection were studied in vitro. These optimum requirements were then tested in a glasshouse under controlled conditions. During the fourth component, ability of the pathogen to infect other plants commonly found in WA and its persistence on the infested trash and infected seed was investigated to determine the survival strategy of the pathogen. Finally, a predictive risk model was developed for WA based on the available information. Across the three survey year, seven virulent isolates of Stemphylium spp. were found. Two of those were highly virulent on susceptible genotypes of NLL whereas five were moderately virulent. One of the highly virulent isolates was collected from the NLL growing in the northern agricultural region of the wheatbelt of WA, while the other was isolated from the lupin breeding shadehouse at Medina. Under favourable conditions in inoculated plots, highly virulent isolates were found to cause up to 60% grain yield loss in susceptible genotypes of NLL. Morphological and molecular characterisation of the virulent isolates was carried out to ascertain the species of the pathogen involved in the disease. In addition to previously reported S. botryosum and S. vesicarium, S. solani -a new record for WA - was found associate with GLS disease in WA. Disease symptoms on NLL seedlings were similar for all isolates and variety resistance was effective against all isolates. Under in vitro conditions, cyclic day/night temperatures of 25/20 oC were optimum for sporulation and germination of the pathogen whereas 30/25 oC favoured the mycelial growth and germ-tube elongation. At 25/20 oC a minimum leaf wetness period of 6 h was required for infection to occur. Leaf wetness of 12 h resulted in appearance of light infection whereas 24 h wetness promoted severe infection in excised NLL leaves under controlled environment conditions. The results of the in-vitro and controlled environment studies were supported by results for spray inoculated seedlings under glasshouse conditions. Both infested trash and infected seed can carry over inoculum between seasons. Spore trapping and trap plant bioassays showed that the pathogen within infested trash remains infective for at least 12 months and that conidia release and seedling infection are closely linked to rainfall events. A weather-driven disease risk model was developed based on data collected from the laboratory, controlled environment, glasshouse and spore trapping studies. The model used weather parameters of temperature and rain days per week to predict disease development and therefore the comparative risk of GLS disease across lupin producing regions of WA for three seasons (2010-2012). Infection risk varied between sites and seasons. The region of greatest risk was identified as the western coastal zone between Perth and Geraldton. Strategies to avoid the pathogens associated with GLS or to manage the risk of disease development can be devised as a direct outcome of this research project.",2014,28/2/2018 6:01,14/3/2023 23:57,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,UWA,,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DNWEHLQE\Ahmad_Arbab_2014.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

The purpose of this situation statement is to provide a snapshot of cotton bush in Western Australia (WA) by describing the current distribution, impact and management in WA, and identifying the major stakeholders that can contribute to the active management of this species. Cotton bush is impacting on the agricultural and community values of the region at a time when there are limited resources available to enforce control measures consistent with its status as a declared pest. As a result, this weed is often not managed to the standard expected by the community. The Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (DAFWA) has made a strategic shift in relation to cotton bush and other widespread declared pest species by moving from an emphasis on requiring compliance by individual affected landholders to a community coordinated approach. This strategic shift is in recognition that the role of government is most appropriate and effective if directed towards prevention and eradication of new pests, rather close involvement with widespread pests. This strategic shift has occurred at the time when the community in the south west (landholders, owners and shires) has developed a heighten awareness of cotton bush as a problem that needs to be addressed, due to its rapid spread in recent years and non-control (or inadequate control) by some landholders. The approach places landholders and land managers (from the community) at the centre of actions to control established declared pests. The approach is based on the community or industry being sufficiently concerned for it to place a priority on the control of particular established declared pests.",2014,28/2/2018 5:37,23/3/2023 5:42,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Department of Agriculture and Food WA,"Western Australia, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\2ISDWVX8\Reeves and Dodd - 2014 - Situation statement cotton bush in Western Austra.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Phil Blume, the project leader, was surprised that many artefacts in the collection were missing important information because the designer or manufacturer was unknown. Since much of the collection is 20th century and these artefacts would have been commonplace around the home or office, he felt this made them good candidates for crowdsourcing this missing information. For a suitable crowdsourcing framework he recalled the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives initiative, which focuses the search on a selected group and encourages the public to send information in return for a reward. The Museum of Design in Plastics welcomed the idea as it combined the opportunity to reach new audiences, enhance public engagement with the collections and provide useful outcomes. In order to link the idea up with current research into crowdsourcing, Adaptive approached the Interactive Technologies Research Group at the University of Brighton. The group recognised that the 10 Most Wanted concept posed a number of interesting research questions and welcomed the opportunity to get involved in the project.",2014,28/2/2018 5:37,23/3/2023 5:50,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,United Kingdom,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UBAAND3P\Lambert et al. - 2014 - 10 Most Wanted - Complex game-based crowdsourcing .pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

It provides a resume of the conclusions about the status and achievability of interoperability existing between the surveyed e-Infrastructures. It highlights the currently known obstacles and makes suggestions for overcoming these . Using a typical use- case drawn from contemporary work on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) the document defines some typical scenarios of interoperability that can be supported by several or all eInfrastructures. The use-case is mapped to the most likely scenario but further work is required at each of 3 levels of interoperability ( applications, service logic, resources) to illustrate how each research infrastructure may support the use case. Building on Deliverable D3.1, on the existing similarities and differences between participating research infrastructures, Deliverable D3.2 aims at presenting a set of guidelines for overcoming obstacles to interoperability. It advises on a roadmap for medium -term (5-7 years) convergence towards worldwide technical interoperability of biodiversity and ecosystem research infrastructures. Thus, it form s a solid knowledge basis for recom mendations on resolution of interoperability in the medium to long-term (deliverable D3.3).",2014,28/2/2018 6:04,23/3/2023 6:12,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Creative-B,Europe,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\WELN9W6D\CReATIVE-B-D3.2.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Given the vast extent of potential preferred Malleefowl habitat across Australia, and the species' ecology, it is difficult to estimate population size based on bird counts. The occurrence of Malleefowl mounds is typically used as a proxy for the bird's occurrence. However, finding Malleefowl mounds can be time consuming, labour intensive, expensive and may not be practical in large areas. To provide greater certainty and transparency in locating Malleefowl mounds, Umwelt has developed a process to identify 'candidate mounds' using LiDAR data and to rank them according to their likelihood of being 'actual mounds'. Because LiDAR can penetrate through vegetation, mounds that are covered or masked by vegetation can also be readily identified. The detection process developed combines rapid analysis of extremely large data sets using Umwelt's in-house software Anditi, with the field knowledge and expertise of our experienced ecologists. Where available, aerial photography is incorporated into the software to provide additional information on habitat and landscape context for the area surrounding candidate mounds. The combination of computer analysis and ecological expertise allows candidate mounds to be quickly virtually accessed in 3D on computer, and then GPS locations recorded for subsequent ground-truthing in the field. This provides repeatability and transferability of the Malleefowl survey process through providing a 3D image of ground and vegetation surrounding each site, while significantly reducing the costs and time required for field surveys.",2014,28/2/2018 5:37,11/1/2021 8:08,,140-150,,,,NA,,,of the 5th National Malleefowl Forum,NA,NA,,,,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\CSU3Q7VG\21_V Saffer_Use of LiDAR.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Download citation Copy link Abstract As a sunburnt country with droughts and flooding rains, rainforest and deserts, cities and the outback, Australia has a highly complex environment with widely variable issues across the landscape. In the 1990s, the Australian government supported a move to catchment-based natural resource management, which has built over a decade of learnings in how to achieve societal change at catchment scale under a range of different models. As one of the 56 regional bodies, Condamine Alliance have tested many innovative approaches, and have compiled invaluable insider knowledge on what has worked and what hasn't throughout this period. Natural resource management projects in the Condamine catchment have been built on partnerships in their truest form - everyone has ""skin in the game""; everyone invests (time and/or money) and everyone benefits. These partnerships ensure the buy-in and ownership necessary for success, and increase the buying potential of any individual investment. This partnership approach has also facilitated focusing on real priorities, as those involved need to all value an activity for it to happen; no one gets their outcomes for free. This legacy of ownership supports the continuation of work after the projects move on to other issues, with networks and skills left behind to maintain and expand upon the outcomes over time. The fish are back! Over 65 local organisations have worked on the River Rescue program over 10 years to finally see the return of fish species lost from the system, expanded ranges of some native fish species now seen 100 km past their previously known extent, and increases in other native species populations by 200% and even 1000%. Together we scooped the Australian Riverprize, the national Banksia Award for Water and the United Nations Prime Ministers Award for Water. Celebrations of these and other collective successes have been an integral component of cementing the partnership approach, and maintaining momentum in sometimes difficult and slow change processes. From 2 year flood recovery projects to 10 year multi-award winning river recovery programs, the Condamine catchment has seen significant investment in improving the condition of its natural resources. The catchment-based partnership approach has built the region's capacity in a way that provides legacy way past the direct environmental benefits to the catchment and into the resilience of the catchment community. With the catchment's critical position in the headwaters of the nationally important Murray Darling Basin, these successes are significant to the sustainability and resilience of Australia as a nation, and can provide important learnings of relevance to other regions and nations across the world",2014,28/2/2018 6:07,28/2/2023 2:05,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\V9E8KRNC\What's_the_secret_An_Australi.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Experiments using the proposed algorithms show up to a 45-fold increase in ability to reach consensus when compared to majority voting using exact string matching.

Although the main aim of most weed societies is to take a role in actively promoting awareness of weeds, weed societies offer much more. Events hosted by weed societies provide opportunities for participants to hear of projects being undertaken by a wide variety of people from weed experts through to community groups at local, state, federal and even international levels or combinations of any of these. Often, people come to weed society functions from an array of organisations and would not necessarily be given opportunities to share their work with a wider audience otherwise. Speak to those involved in weed societies and you will be met with enthusiasm of how society networking has returned benefits that would never have been possible otherwise. Participants may see a presentation that provides valuable information, or a casual chat with a fellow participant may prove to be a fruitful link in sourcing an expert or even funding towards a project. For example, when Tasmanian and Victorian weed risk assessment staff met at a Weed Society of Victoria conference, a professional link was established. This led to the sharing of scientific research and literature that ultimately supported the declaration of several invasive species in Tasmania.

An estimated 65% of the specimens have been digitized (in some form) and 30% published to the GBIF portal. Recent large-scale digitization efforts in Norway have focused on the imaging of a large number of specimens accompanied by initial minimal database registration, limited to scientific name, year and the country where the specimen was collected. The registration of more complete label information is recognized to require laborious efforts and it was decided to explore a citizen science approach with a volunteer transcription portal. After exploring similar volunteer transcription portals (such as the portals from the Botanical Society of Britain & Ireland, Atlas of Living Australia, National Museum of Natural History in Paris and Smithsonian), the Natural History Museum in Oslo initiated contact and collaboration with the Notes from Nature team. A simplified software implementation, based on Notes from Nature, was developed at the Natural History Museum in Oslo during the first months of 2014 and launched on June 1 (http://gbif.no/transcribe/). The first collection of images to be made available for volunteer transcription included 2850 non-digitized specimens from the Lichen herbarium collected in Africa.

However, this biota is more notable for its endemism than its richness (e.g. 94% of Australian frog species are found nowhere else). Australia is distinctive, not only in terms of endemism, but also in terms of evolutionary adaptations (e.g. large hopping mammals) and ecological processes (e.g. nutrient cycling by fire). Distinctiveness is attributed to three principal factors: (1) a long period of geographic isolation; (2) the preponderance of ancient soils low in key nutrients; and (3) an increasingly arid and inherently unpredictable climate. Australia is also unfortunately distinctive in the scale of biodiversity loss since European settlement with 98 species and subspecies listed as extinct, and a further 1700 threatened with extinction. Both for historical extinctions and currently threatened species, habitat loss and introduced species are the key threats, while climate change is the emerging and possibly most significant threat of the twenty-first century. In the face of these perils, Australia's distinctive wildlife needs special attention because it makes such a large contribution to the biodiversity and cumulative evolutionary history of the planet. Introduction Australia is a biologically unusual continent. This is easily shown by a few examples such as the presence of large hopping marsupials, the prevalence of fire-adapted vegetation, and the sheer diversity of arid-zone lizards. Entire groups of organisms are found nowhere else. Many more are largely confined to the Australian continent, with only a few representatives on nearby islands, such as New Guinea. While visiting Australia and pondering the unusual Australian animals, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary: ""An unbeliever in everything beyond his own reason, might exclaim 'Surely two distinct creators must have been at work ...'"" (p.402 of Darwin, 2001). The Australian fauna was so different from that found in Europe, Asia or the Americas, it was as though it was created completely separately from that elsewhere. Of course, Darwin was essentially correct in that Australian wildlife, to a large extent, have been 'created' separately. This separateness, however, was not the work of a separate supernatural entity, but rather the result of a long period of independent evolution on an isolated continent subjected to significant and unusual environmental change.",2014,28/2/2018 5:37,11/1/2021 7:42,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Cambridge University Press,,not specified,,,,,GS 2014,,10.1017/CBO9781139519960,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\32B4J87Z\9781107033542_excerpt.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

All the plants selected for this study by the Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants were done so on the basis of their reputation of protracted use over thousands of years to treat cancer in TCM, nine out of the 34, specifically with anti-cancer claims. Therefore, the working hypothesis of this study was: Each plant chosen for this study out of the ancient pharmacopeia of Traditional Chinese Medicine will show at least 60% in vitro inhibition in at least one human cancer cell line without showing over 25% inhibition in vitro in at least one normal human cell line. Background information on each of the 34 plants used in this study was collected as to their order, family genus and species, native habitat, uses in TCM and other folk medicines as well as what compounds that have been discovered from them. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 4 fractionations of each plant, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water, from 34 of the most used plants in TCM for a total of 136 extracts and their in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines of breast, bone and lung, to test their respective toxicity in vitro against normal human breast and lung cell lines. The materials used were the breast cancer cell lines BT20 and MCF7, the lung cancer cell line A549 and bone cancer line U2OS with normal lines of breast and lung, HMEC and HPL1A respectively, serving as controls, all tested in accordance with the Alamar Blue screening assay protocol. Fluorescence readings which correlated with cell viability were measured using a micro plate reader that measured fluorescence excitation wavelength of 555nm and emission wavelength of at 585nm and the percent inhibition of extracts was calculated along with selectivity to reveal 46 solid hits from 20 of the 34 plants that had at least a 4 fold selectivity score and a minimum of 60% inhibition in at least one of the cancer cell lines and no more than a 25% inhibition in either of the two normal cell lines. Of the 135 extracts tested, (the water extract of Rubus reflexus Ker var lancelobus Metc. was lost), 34.0% were identified as hits with significant enough activity found in 58.8% of the plants to warrant further investigation by the criteria set forth by this study.

Despite morphological features separating this genus from the closely related two genera Capillipedium and Dichanthium, (the three hereafter will be called BCD), De Wet and Harlan introduced the compilospecies complex to show the interbreeding phenomena that occurred among species of these genera. This study was carried out to assess species/genus relatedness of the BCD complex using different evidences from morphology, molecular information and genomic content. Nineteen morphological characters were observed, three regions (trnT-F, rps16 intron and 3'trnK) of chloroplast genome phylogenetic were used in phylogenetic reconstruction, and chromosome counting as well as flow cytometry for chromosome number and genome size were conducted during the study. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MP with NJ for morphological data, and MP, RAxML, and BI for molecular data. Based on morphology, all three genera were separated as monophyletic units. Bothriochloa consisted of two clades. However, phylogenetic analyses based on chloroplast genomic regions reveal that Bothriochloa and Dichanthium are paraphyletic clades and only Capillipedium is resolved as a monophyletic clade. The concatenated data set has performed better than individual data sets in terms of resolution and support for clades. Flow-cytometry and chromosome counting only found diploid and tetraploid but not hexaplod species. TCS network reveals that tetraploidization followed different pathways from the ancestral diploid species. This study provided new insight onto the evolution of the chloroplast genome in the compilospecies and empirical evidence of species grouping of the compilospecies based on morphology.",2015,28/2/2018 6:07,15/3/2023 0:07,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Virgiinia Polytechnic Isntitute and State University,,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\BT8KLZQB\Sumadijaya_A_T_2015.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Pests and diseases contribute to the population losses experienced globally. Brood disease is of concern for the apiculture industry because of the direct effects it has on population numbers and despite control measures; resistance to antibiotics and pesticides are common. Alternative pollinators such as stingless bees, including Tetragonula carbonaria, appear to be less impacted by brood diseases. However, there is very little information regarding why this is so. Prior to this study, there are only a few indications about a possible bacterial brood disease in Brazilian stingless bees (Kerr 1948, Nogueira-Neto 1997), with no follow up investigations, and no cases of brood disease losses in Australian stingless bees. As a result, this study presents information on the behavioural and antimicrobial defences of T. carbonaria colonies as mechanisms to limit the development of brood pathogens. In addition to these aims and objectives, this study also introduces and documents the first disease causing brood pathogen in Australian stingless bees. Therefore, the interaction of the defence mechanisms and the identified brood pathogen was also explored.    Suitable nest conditions need to exist to sustain pathogen growth and development. Apis mellifera pathogens such as Paenibacillus larvae and Ascosphaera apis utilise nest conditions, especially in the brood area for growth. The limited number of stingless bee pathogens may be related to brood temperature. Thermoregulation behaviour has been investigated in a number of stingless bee species; however, Australian studies are limited to Austroplebeia australis (Halcroft et al. 2013b) and greenhouse maintained T. carbonaria colonies (Amano et al. 2000, Amano 2004, A. Tse, pers. comm., 2011), with outcomes applied to their pollination servicing. This study (Chapter 2) investigated T. carbonaria thermoregulation behaviours during fluctuating ambient temperatures and the influence these have on brood production. Over the 13-month study, T. carbonaria was able to maintain brood temperatures between 15-31ºC, despite ambient temperatures ranging from 0-37°C. The recorded brood temperatures resulted in colonies maintaining yearlong brood development, which would suggest that this could provide a suitable resource for pathogen development year-round. However, pathogen occurrences are rare, it is speculated that the greater brood temperature range which is tolerated by colonies, is ultimately unsuitable for brood pathogen development, especially the lower winter temperatures.",2015,21/1/2020 3:22,8/1/2021 7:52,,,308,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Western Sydney (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1949731730,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\6ABXDBXZ\Shanks - 2015 - Tetragonula carbonaria and disease Behavioural an.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Cicadoidea is currently divided into Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae, and this into three subfamilies: Cicadinae, Cicadettinae and Tibicininae. Cicadinae has many neotropical tribes, Fidicinini, one of the most representative, is divided into Fidicinina and Guyalnina and has 16 genera. Into Fidicinina, Fidicina and Fidicinoides are the ones with highest number of described species and none of the other genera of the tribe has a taxomic revision, being absent publications that establish characters to distinguish them. Into Guyalnina, Dorisiana has economic importance as pest of coffee and also taxonomic problems, besides the lack of morphological characters needed for its determination, which is increased by the lack of a review covering all genera present in the tribe. The general goal of this work was execute the taxonomic revision of Dorisiana species improving the knowledge about the taxon, with the specific objective to analyze the morphology of the genus from deposited specimens of collections of national and international institutions; describe the morphological species, including photographs and ilustrations, mostly of the male genitalia; produce a pictorial dichotomous key to distinguish the Dorisiana species. Therefore, of the 16 species of the genus, previously known, four were synonymized, two new combinations and two new species were described, totaling 16 valid species, covered in the pictorial dichotomous key.From these results and studies that led to it, is perceived a great lack of group by works that delimit characters needed for your determination, for genus and species, which is also shared by others neotropical tribes.

Kosciuszko National Park is home to a horse population of an estimated 6000 horses. The presence of these horses within the park is highly controversial due to a range of stakeholders having different perspectives based on different contexts that horses can be placed in. With the 2008 Horse Management Plan up for review in 2013, the re-introduction of aerial culling as a control method was being considered. This created a large divide and subsequent debates around factors such as actual horse numbers in the park, horse impacts, horse control methods and the ideas around the horses' right to belong in the Park. Data for this project was accessed through a range of sources such as semistructured interviews and online content that was made available through discussion forums and social media. A main focus of the methodology involved situating myself within the project to experience an entirely embodied approach to the research, therefore introducing the idea of 'brumbiness'. Analysis of the debate was approached by using the conceptual tool of assemblage thinking. By investigating the assemblages of the horse, the horse was deconstructed which allowed the debate to be analysed through these various horse constructs. An analysis of the 2008 Horse Management Plan opened up the view of the NPWS as seeing the horse as feral. Analysis of the public debate saw the horse assembled as 'brumby' or 'feral', and the politics of blame were explored to uncover different perspectives towards impacts within Kosciuszko National Park. Horse narratives were also analysed to give further insight into the assemblage of the horse as a brumby, and how connections that develop between humans and horses play an integral part in the forming of people's experiences of brumbiness.",2015,28/2/2018 6:06,15/3/2023 0:10,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Wollongong,,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DQM7VLTP\Assembling Horses in Kosciuszko National Park.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

M.","Patterns of Sea Spurge (Euphorbia Paralias) Invasion in New South Wales, Australia",,,,,http://ro.uow.edu.au/thsci/117/,"Environmental weeds pose an ongoing problem for biodiversity values around the world. To deal with widespread weed invasions in the face of limitations on resources, practical and achievable management strategies must be developed. Where prevention and total eradication is not feasible, many weed management strategies are based around establishing containment zones to arrest further spread. To be effective, containment zones must consider the dispersal distance of the invader, to ensure that an adequate proportion of the population's recruitment in new area is removed before becoming established. Optimisation of surveillance strategies is desirable to achieve this, and is typically done through modelling the distribution of the species or its pathways of dispersal to locate and target areas most at risk of invasion. For coastal dune weeds such as sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias) efforts to model dispersal distances and pathways can be complicated by long-distance marine dispersal of propagules. The aim of this study was to establish the distribution of sea spurge along the coast of New South Wales, Australia, where invasion has progressed from the south over the past few decades. Over the invasion front, an attempt was made to determine any factors making beaches more susceptible to invasion so that surveillance actions might be optimised. Considering the role of propagule pressure in driving invasion, beach attributes were selected pertaining to likelihood of propagule stranding at a beach, such as orientation and wave energy, as well as latitude and an index of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, sea spurge management actions undertaken by the Far South Coast National Parks and Wildlife Services at the bottom of coastal NSW were used as a case study to assess the effect of ongoing management of sea spurge populations on undisturbed NSW beaches. Presence/absence data for sea spurge was obtained for a total of 481 beaches on the NSW coast through information gathered from land managers, management documents and field surveys, with sea spurge having invaded 309 (64.2%). The likely northern extent of the invasion was determined. Latitude was found to have an influence on sea spurge invasion, with invasions becoming more infrequent moving north. This relationship can be used to prioritize surveillance for emergent populations which otherwise appeared uninfluenced by beach characteristics. The FSC NPWS management programme showed that with sustained effort, sea spurge populations can be reduced substantially to the effect of minimising propagule output, but total eradication was not possible. These findings can be used to inform a state-wide management strategy for responding to sea spurge invasion by helping establish containment zone parameters, and setting effective regional management goals with the outcome of stopping or slowing the invasion.",2015,28/2/2018 6:05,15/3/2023 0:11,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Wollongong,,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\4YRGAPUK\PATTERNS OF SEA SPURGE (EUPHORBIA PARALIAS) IN.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

An extensive 2006 research project found that museums have a responsibility to present contemporary issues, providing visitors are given a meaningful opportunity to contribute to that discussion. This thesis builds upon that finding to evaluate the effectiveness of networked media - digital communication technology - in fostering discussion between visitors about issues such as climate change, refugees and terrorism. To test the capability of this strategy, visitors to an exhibition about Australian immigration policies were asked to use an iPad application to provide their own views on the exhibition's content and interact with other visitor contributions. The results demonstrate widespread support from visitors for the use of this type of technology. Museum staff also reacted favourably to findings that show visitors using networked media engage more deeply with exhibition content.    However, the research also reveals a set of problems relating to the use of networked media in exhibitions about contemporary issues. These problems are categorised into two analytical chapters in this thesis. The first considers the extent to which museum staff must curate or moderate the contributions of the visiting public. The second considers the ethical and logistical issues relating to the digital dissemination of museum content. The conclusions stemming from this analysis show that networked media strategies can be highly valuable communicative tools in difficult exhibitions, provided that they are carefully designed and implemented by museum staff.    Strategies shown to be effective include the integration of physical and online museum spaces, through mobile devices and standalone applications. The opportunity for meaningful visitor contribution is afforded by facilitating continuing debate outside the museum, and the active involvement of museum staff and other experts in discussions. Museums also benefit from the creation of digital partnerships, with other museums, institutions and the interested public to meaningfully engage with the contemporary issues that are critically important to visitors.",2015,21/1/2020 3:22,14/3/2023 5:14,,,171,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,M.Phil.,,2013312429,ProQuest,,DOI: 10.25911/5d6f9ef24408e,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UGS2CVFK\Dunstan - 2015 - Sites Contested, Ideas Connected Networked Media .pdf",,5 - ALA mentioned

The central approach is to obtain genome-wide genetic markers using NGS, and then use these markers to first, infer the genetic diversity of populations of Santalum acuminatum, a sister species of Santalum spicatum or Australian sandalwood, across South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales; second, to explore the feasibility of this approach in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between species, some of which exhibit morphological phenotypes that make their identification difficult. Included in this work is an exploration of the utility of NGS platforms for 'deep' sequencing traditional markers (ccmp2, trnL, nrITS) and a consideration of their applications for various areas of research. To give a time perspective to the work, an isotope and macrofossil analysis of cave sediments, to infer past plant vegetation and climate scenarios, closes the data chapters. Among the results inferred from markers obtained from the Ion Torrent are that the genetic diversity of S. acuminatum appeared to be low and a population structure analysis reveals a mixing of genotypes across the geographic range of the populations assessed. The phylogenomics of Santalum using NGS markers revealed a similar path of dispersals out of Australia and into the Pacific as reported in previous studies, but with fewer events than previously thought. It was also found that there appear to have been hybridisation between species in some populations of Santalum in the dry lands of South Australia. As well, it was found to be quite feasible to deep sequence traditional markers, such as chloroplast locus ccmp2, proving that they can be applied in new ways for research in metabarcoding of bulk samples. This novel application of traditional markers can then be applied in studies of soil sediments, as another proxy to sedimentary studies alongside isotope and macrofossil analyses. Together, the set of studies presented in this thesis represent an interdisciplinary approach to a botanical study and begins to answer questions concerning the relationship between humans and plants. It is possible to integrate a battery of methods to study a highly exploited plant genus such as Santalum in its long historical trajectory with our species, and obtain results that can help in proposing potential solutions for its future sustainable management.",2015,28/2/2018 6:03,15/3/2023 0:13,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Adelaide,,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\TAGMDVJS\Fuentes-Cross - 2015 - New approaches to explore the past and present div.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Around 70,000 species are in use for medicinal purposes in a broader sense. Different regions of the world have different preferences in the use and consumption of medicinal plants. Due to an increased global interest in the use of medicinal and aromatic plants, various conservation strategies including both in situ and ex situ conservation are necessary. Especially gene banks play a large role in maintaining genetic resources and have a high potential for breeding efforts. The present study has been concerned with providing an overview of the plant genetic resources available worldwide in gene banks. In total, passport data about four million available gene bank accessions over all continents was compiled. From these, more than 700,000 medicinal and aromatic plant accessions could be found. However, from more than 1000 species, no sample exists in any collection; and many species have a very low number of samples. Some of the species are extinct in the wild or critically endangered.

What the Atlas doesn't have however is a systematic framework for dealing with invasive species. The lack of consistent, comprehensive and agreed definitions of invasive status is a hurdle for the effective management of invasive species. This is surprising given the international economic and ecological impact of invasive species. The inclusion of invasion status into information management systems would add significant value for practitioners, researchers and policy makers. The Convention on Biological Diversity's Global Invasive Alien Species Information Partnership (GIASIP: http://giasipartnership. myspecies.info/) is ideally placed internationally to improve data integration, quality and access across a highly fragmented environment with key gaps in biogeography, taxonomy and standards. The ALA is well positioned to help identify information gaps such as this. For example, lists could be created for species considered to have a particular invasive status (http://lists.ala.org.au). Such lists on the ALA are created and maintained by any one or more ALA-registered users or groups of users and can be used by anyone. Species names are checked against the National Species List and then linked to all related Atlas data.

This shape descriptor is insensitive to noise and robust with respect to occlusions. AII intrinsically introduces the notion of scale using the size of kernel radius. However how to select an optimal scale remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a local scale selection scheme for generating multiscale area integral invariants. For the same scale level, the disc kernel size is not fixed and varies with the contour point where the disc is centered. This scheme also provides a scale assignment for emphasising the features extraction at finer scales. The strong discriminative power of the multiscale area integral invariant derived from the proposed scale selection scheme has been validated through experiments on very challenging leaf image retrievals.

It is crucial for us to prevent this in the future. The first step of this process is to identify correctly an invasive species from native ones. Current identification methods, relying on mainly 2D images, can result in low accuracy and be time consuming. Such methods provide little help to a quarantine officer who has time constraints to response when on duty. To deal with this problem, we propose new solutions using 3D virtual models of insects. We explain how working with insects in the 3D domain can be much better than the 2D domain. We also describe how to create true-color 3D models of insects using an image-based 3D reconstruction method. This method is ideal for quarantine control and inspection tasks that involve the verification of a physical specimen against known invasive species. Finally we show that these insect models provide valuable material for other applications such as research, education, arts and entertainment.

Alarm bells have rung for years about the need to go faster, the need to attract and train new taxonomic workers, and the need to convince other branches of science that taxonomic work is vital. Morphological taxonomy is either being overrun or augmented - depending on your perspective - by genomics, artificial intelligence, new imaging methods and species-related data from other branches of science. Ecology is one such branch of science, where defining, documenting and managing information about species traits has emerged as one of the most significant problems in the discipline. Traits have been recorded for aeons, but the resulting data has largely been insulated within cliques. How do we integrate these data and make them available in a form that will help to address significant issues about our environment? The 'speed bumps' on the route to a useful solution may be more social than technical. Cross-disciplinary collaboration is required to address the big questions in biodiversity research today, and it will need to extend beyond taxonomy and ecology to other disciplines, such as pharmacology and material science. As Harry Truman said, and John LaSalle often quoted, ""It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit"".

It was recognised in 2000 as one of the World's 'Biodiversity Hotspots', based on its highly diverse, endemic and threatened flora. The Greater Perth region is particularly well-known for its species richness and endemism, being home to numerous Declared Rare Flora (DRF) and Priority species as well as Threatened Ecological Communities (TEC). The area of the proposed Yule Brook Regional Park is a veritable epicentre of this biodiversity, but is under real threat from encroaching development. To be able to conserve threatened plant species, the numerous animals and fungi that depend upon them, and the habitats they live in, we need to understand their functioning both in the past and present. A Jewel in the Crown of a Global Biodiversity Hotspot has been assembled using current research and understanding about the geology, hydrology, soils, flora, fauna, fungi, archaeology, history and other aspects relevant for the establishment of a first-class Regional Park. Those who worked to complete this book represent a much larger group determined that the region will be enhanced and protected as a Regional Park.

The European Union Funded Creative-B Project (see https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100345/brief/en) outlined the status and strategy for interoperability between what they termed Biodiversity Research Infrastructures (BRIs: such as the Global Biodiversity Information Infrastructure (GBIF), the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio)). Toward the end of that project, the group decided that a logical follow-on project should position BRIs to support the production of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs). This idea became the GLOBal Infrastructures for Supporting Biodiversity research (GLOBIS-B) project (http://www.globis-b.eu) and this presentation provides a summary of a case study on generating EBVs (Hardisty et al. 2019). As a part of GLOBIS-B, I suggested that a small team of GLOBIS members should document in detail, each step in the production of an EBV from GBIF and the ALA data for a few invasive species. We wanted address the rarity of detailed recording and justification for each step in the production of a dataset for environmental evaluation. I anticipated that the team would encounter many practical issues, but this case study raised far more significant issues that any of us had anticipated. The EBV chosen for this study was Area of Occupancy (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2017) and the species selected represented various invasion scenarios: Acacia longifolia; Vespula germanica and Bubulcus ibis. The workflow included 20 steps between locating data and publishing an EBV, and these steps were radically different between GBIF and the ALA. The workflow required manual steps such as resolving invasive status of Acacia longifolia subspecies; only one of which was 'invasive'. Datasets of occurrence records had to be exported from the ALA and GBIF to enable filtering for purpose, for example, not all Darwin Core terms are exposed in the current public interface of the ALA. After the record filtering, the ALA and GBIF datasets then required merging and deduplication, for which one-off code had to be written. A few of the 15 significant messages from this study included: a lack of consistency of data between BRIs (e.g., GBIF records should be a superset of ALA records); consistency and adequacy of filtering tools between BRIs; exported data structures massively differed between BRIs; that automation of the workflows may be possible but many manual intervention steps were required. By my figuring, the case study took approximately 10 times longer than anticipated, but the messages to BRIs was clear - consistency and adequacy of data and tools require urgent work.",2019,16/7/2019 1:36,16/7/2019 1:37,,e37791,,,3,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Leiden, Netherlands",not specified,,,,,GS 2019,,10.3897/biss.3.37791,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\XZ88CZNJ\Belbin and Hobern - 2019 - Supporting Essential Biodiversity Variables The G.pdf,,ALA author

While there has been significant progress in establishing national databases for the management of species observation data, these only represent samples of a species' total distribution. The need and challenge therefore is to model these point-based observation data to obtain estimates or projections of the total range and distribution of the species. Such Species Distribution Models (SDMs), also known as Environmental Niche Models (ENMs), and the geographic data (or ""maps"") they generate, provide vital information needed by governments at all levels to meet various policy and statutory responsibilities and obligations. SDMs quantify the response of species occurrence to environmental conditions described by variables such as climate, substrate, productivity and vegetation. The outcomes of an SDM can be used to identify locations and regions with potentially suitable environmental conditions for a species, as well as assess how species may respond to projected future climate changes or habitat loss. While SDMs are widely used in many decision- and policy-making programs, investment in species distribution information has been fragmented and limited.",2019,7/7/2019 23:46,7/7/2019 23:59,,e37441,,,3,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Leiden, Netherlands",English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.3897/biss.3.37441,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\TPF8XJ43\Huijbers et al. - 2019 - Towards an Integrated Biodiversity Technology Prog.pdf,,ALA author

We will give an update of the state of progress to date, along with lessons learnt and summarise a roadmap for the future. Recognising that significant overlap exists in the function of the systems, and that advancement in technology allows GBIF.org to offer more functionality, we have initiated a process of exploring better alignment of these infrastructures. Such a move is expected to bring the benefits of consistent data handling, improved citation tracking, coordinated deployment of new features across the entire data publishing community, better reuse of modules and an overall reduction in cost of development, deployment and operation. Our initial areas of exploration focuses on two specific components which are common to most biodiversity portals: a registry of datasets and the indexing of occurrence data. Use of a common registry for organisations, collections, datasets and associated metadata will reduce the effort spent in curating content, while also improving consistency by removing the need for synchronisation. In addition, a revised data pipeline for the indexing of occurrence records that powers both GBIF.org and ALA is anticipated to accommodate features such as consistent flagging of data quality issues and standardised practice for citation and tracking citations.",2019,19/6/2019 4:04,19/6/2019 4:11,,e35867,,,3,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Leiden, Netherlands",English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.3897/biss.3.35867,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\53H735KT\Robertson et al. - 2019 - Aligning GBIF.org and the Atlas of Living Australi.pdf,,ALA author

At least 496 aquatic invertebrate taxa have now been collected, nearly half of which were first collected in 2017. The species pool at individual springs and across the springs would further increase with additional sampling. The springs were large compared to the sampling effort and sampling effort has been uneven across the range of springs, so it is difficult to compare invertebrate communities of the springs, but at present there is little evidence of subgroups of springs based on their aquatic invertebrate faunas, excepting that springs in the central Kimberley remain relatively poorly sampled. An analysis of the distribution and habitat associations of the invertebrates is hampered by low survey effort at other types of wetlands in the Kimberley and the paucity of readily accessible aquatic invertebrate data for northern Australia. Most individual species are likely to be widely distributed in the region, but a small suite of species is likely to be rare and possibly restricted to these springs or other groundwater discharge areas in the Kimberley. There was some overlap with composition of similar organic mound springs at Walyarta, but with many species known only from the Kimberley or Walyarta springs. The composition of the aquatic invertebrate fauna of the Kimberley Mound Springs is unlikely to be replicated in other wetlands within the region or elsewhere in Western Australia.",2020,28/4/2020 2:03,23/3/2023 9:29,,20-47,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Department of Biodiversity, Conservation & Attractions","Kensington, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\CNCALBHP\Pinder et al. - 2020 - Biodiversity survey, mapping, delineation and asse.pdf",,2 - ALA cited

This chapter demonstrates the interrelatedness between people and nature, that is a coupled human and natural system. The concept of a green city is based on understanding the ecosystem harm caused by urbanisation, and how this is compromising liveability and reconciling the impacts to bring about better ecosystem, people and built outcomes. Key to this is how people understand the urban ecosystem (environment as a public good; ecological literacy) and its role in supporting built and natural systems. The chapter concludes by illustrating how urban ecosystems can be supported through a vast array of actions at different scales - from a suburban garden to a whole city - and the use of technological approaches (green infrastructure).",2020,28/7/2020 2:14,28/7/2020 2:15,,179-194,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Springer,Singapore,English,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1007/978-981-15-4386-9_12,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QEYYV4SP\Keane and Davies - 2020 - Green Cities.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Different forms of general surveillance are already making a considerable contribution to Australia's biosecurity system. However, such initiatives can be challenging to instigate and maintain due to interrelated social, institutional, organisational, ecological and infrastructure dimensions. Much of the literature dealing with general surveillance focuses on certain aspects of general surveillance only, such as data management, community engagement or the development of smart phone applications. In addition, there is considerable fragmentation between sectors (plant, animal, marine and environment) in their pursuits to progress general surveillance with limited sharing of lessons learned between them. In response to these challenges this report explores general surveillance from a holistic systems thinking perspective by compiling lessons learned from recent literature to capture key considerations for the different system components and the dynamics between them.",2020,21/7/2020 3:35,23/3/2023 9:28,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,ABARES,"Canberra, Australia",not specified,,Research report,,,GS 2020,,10.25814/5ee06c0f623fc,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\4232RLUQ\Kruger et al. - 2020 - Understanding general surveillance for biosecurity.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed

This addresses a critical need for the DiSSCo (Distributed System of Scientific Collections) initiative and DiSSCo's associated infrastructure. Task 2.2 as a pilot endeavour (Technical Readiness Level1 (TRL) 6), only includes the high-level information from 9 partner NSCs, covering the number of objects, taxonomic scope, collections storage categories, stratigraphy, geospatial range and level of detail in digitisation according to standards. This information is structured through a standardised Collection Classification Scheme and displayed with associated metrics. Task 2.2 builds upon a preliminary design of a CDD (TRL 3) that was itself a Deliverable of the now finalised EC funded ICEDIG project where the user needs analysis sought to balance between the effort of data acquisition from partners with the data granularity required to address the compiled user stories.

PKPTYQP5,conferencePaper,2018,"Newman, P.; Dettki, H.; Belbin, L.",What Went Where When? Representing Animal Movements as Simple Darwin Core Occurrences,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,,,10.3897/biss.2.25664,https://biss.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=25664,"To usefully describe sensor deployments on animals is a major challenge for advocates of data standards. Bio-logging studies also need to be documented in a standard manner to facilitate discovery and determine relevance? For systems aggregating biodiversity occurrence records, the use of the Darwin Core standard (Wieczorek et al. 2012) to express species occurrences is near ubiquitous. Bio-logging studies are universally multiple instances of species occurrences that output high quality spatial and temporal data recorded by specialists. There are a lot of benefits to summarising these studies by means of a single, flat file record. Simple Darwin Core offers the ability to do this by representing the multiple occurrences as a date range in dwc:eventDate and a footprint polygon using dwc:footprintWKT for the area covered by the track. By also uniformly describing the species, the dwc:basisOfRecord as Machine Observation, and a controlled vocabulary to describe the type of bio-logging data, systems could offer an effective means of querying tracking data. It's important to look to other data standards initiatives relevant to bio-logging to ensure common usage of Darwin Core terms. The Atlas of Living Australia is using an implementation of Simple Darwin Core to represent data from the bio-logging platform ZoaTrack as occurrence data to make it discoverable via location or species-based searches. Other initiatives, for example Swedish LifeWatch follow a similar approach to represent data from the Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring (WRAM) Scandinavian bio-logging infrastructure. With endorsement from the community, the implementation could be useful as a type of metadata catalogue record, opening it for usage in application programmer interface (API) development and thus enabling machine interoperability between systems and users. In short, bio-logging systems and practitioners would be able to easily discover relevant studies by searching by location and/or species.",2018,5/6/2018 4:39,4/1/2021 6:51,,e25664,,,2,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Dunedin, NZ",English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.3897/biss.2.25664,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\T6SJYB5K\Newman et al. - 2018 - What Went Where When Representing Animal Movement.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned; ALA author

In order to help other GBIF nodes or institutions, they made all of their modules publicly available for reuse and customization through GitHub (https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia). Since 2013, the community created by developers interested by ALA tools, organized, with the help of GBIF, 8 technical workshops around the world. These workshops helped the launch of at least 13 data portals. The last training session, funded through the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (https://www.gbif.org/programme/82219/capacity-enhancement-support-programme), was been attended by 23 participants from 19 countries on 6 continents. Moreover, on the new GBIF website, a section has been dedicated to this programme (https://www.gbif.org/programme/82953/living-atlases), the Living Atlases community official website has been launched in 2017 (https://living-atlases.gbif.org) and the technical documentation has been improved and translated in several languages.

It provides an integrated model of public knowledge production and engagement with science. As a growing worldwide phenomenon, it is invigorated by evolving new technologies that connect people easily and effectively with the scientific community. Catalysed by citizens' wishes to be actively involved in scientific processes, as a result of recent societal trends, it also offers contributions to the rise in tertiary education. In addition, citizen science provides a valuable tool for citizens to play a more active role in sustainable development.This book identifies and explains the role of citizen science within innovation in science and society, and as a vibrant and productive science-policy interface. The scope of this volume is global, geared towards identifying solutions and lessons to be applied across science, practice and policy.

These records represent the contributions from data providers linked to the nodes of GBIF. From this number, more than 39 million records come from French institutions. National portals can provide a tailored view for a country, allowing a node to bring together region-specific information (attribution, species lists and traits, spatial layers) to further enhance the basic occurrence information. They also provide an important mechanism to galvanize data mobilization efforts within a country. GBIF France (http://www.gbif.fr) launched two main functionalities of its new portal (http://portail.gbif.fr/) based on Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) modules at the end of May 2015: the GBIF France's metadata portal (http://metadonnee.gbif.fr) and the GBIF France's data portal (http://recherche.gbif.fr/). During the 10 year anniversary of GBIF France, on the 10 of June 2016, we launched the first version of our new spatial portal (http://spatial.gbif.fr/) also based on the ALA platform. For now, only the data search engine and the metadata portal have been translated in French. In the coming year, we will also translate the spatial portal into French and we will add more tools developed by ALA teams and the community into our new portal. We have been able to customize this generic infrastructure to our local needs (e.g., links to different GBIF France's partners) and requests (e.g., adding a map to the result page), styling the portal so that it can be integrated into our national website, translating our data portal into French and integrating pre-existing components developed by the French team. th t 2/2 During this demonstration, we will mostly focus on the data portal in order to show how it works but it will also give you a concrete example of ALA modules installed and configured for another country.

Data from both specimen backed and non-specimen backed data are also accessible via the Atlas of Living Australia. Submission of weed specimens by the community between 2013 and 2015 has allowed 383 incursions of 88 priority weed species to be notified to Biosecurity Queensland and local government officers, as well as other weed and land management organisations. In addition to priority weeds, members of the Weed Spotters Network have assisted in detecting newly naturalised and doubtfully naturalised species for Queensland and for Australia. Since 2013, 25 new naturalisations and 31 new 'doubtful naturalisations' have been detected including six species with no previous record in Queensland and eight species not previously known to occur in Australia. By detecting emerging and priority weeds through active surveillance, Weed Spotters are making a valuable contribution to biosecurity in Queensland.",2016,28/2/2018 5:37,5/1/2021 7:01,,17-19,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",not specified,,,,,Web of Science,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\STPD2G2K\Laidlaw et al. - 2016 - Many eyes on the prize the role of citizen scient.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

The information these documents can provide is important, from a historical perspective and mainly because we can learn from it. The automatic digitization of these historical documents is a complex machine learning process that usually produces poor results, requiring costly interventions by experts, who have to transcribe and interpret the content. This paper describes hybrid (Human- and Machine-Intelligent) workflows for scientific data extraction, combining machine-learning and crowdsourcing software elements. Our results demonstrate that the mix of human and machine processes has advantages in data extraction time and quality, when compared to a machine-only workflow. More specifically, we show how OCRopus and Tesseract, two widely used open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools, can improve their accuracy by more than 42%, when text areas are cropped by humans prior to OCR, while the total time can increase or decrease depending on the OCR selection. The digitization of 400 images, with Entomology, Bryophyte, and Lichen specimens, is evaluated following four different approaches: processing the whole specimen image (machine-only), processing crowd cropped labels (hybrid), processing crowd cropped fields (hybrid), and cleaning the machine- only output.

Native forests have, so far, remained largely free of invasive exotic insects. The exotic pines, however, have five well-established and significant invasive pest insects: the bark beetles Ips grandicollis, Hylastes ater, and Hylurgus ligniperda (Coleoptera: Curculiondae), Monterey pine aphid, Essigella californica (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), with the latter not yet present in Western Australia (WA). The exotic giant pine scale, Marchalina hellenica (Hemiptera: Margarodidae), was recently detected on pines in Adelaide and Melbourne and is under an eradication program. Many of the established pest species have had classical biological control programs implemented. European house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a pest of untreated softwood, is established in areas around Perth, WA, and has been found in dead and live trees, as well as untreated timber. African black beetle, Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a major exotic agricultural and forestry pest in wetter parts of the Mediterranean forest regions in WA, where it was first recorded in 1938. Several other exotic polyphagous horticultural pests are occasionally associated with eucalypts. Australia is the origin of major insect pests on Eucalyptus species grown in Mediterranean regions across the globe. However, populations of these insects are generally effectively controlled by native species of natural enemies in Australia. At least five species endemic to eastern Australia, Gonipterus platensis and G. sp. nov. 2, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Paropsisterna m-fuscum (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Phylacteophaga froggatti (Hymenoptera: Pergidae) and Cardiapsina fiscella (Hempitera: Psyllidae), have been introduced to Mediterranean regions of WA, where they initially caused extensive and severe damage to plantations of introduced eucalypt species (predominantly E. globulus) in the region. However, the level and extent of damage gradually decreased, and it has been hypothesised that improved control by endemic natural enemies has occurred.

In native forests, there is a high diversity of phloem and wood borers across several families in the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. In the Coleoptera, cerambycid beetles (Cerambycidae), jewel beetles (Buprestidae), bark, ambrosia and pinhole beetles (Curculionidae) and pinworms (Lymexelidae) are some of the most commonly found beetles attacking eucalypts and acacias. In the Lepidoptera, wood moths (Cossidae), ghost moths (Hepialidae) and borers in the Xyloryctidae (subfamily Xyloryctinae) are most common. In contrast to native forests, there is a much more limited range of native insects present in Australian plantations, particularly in exotic Pinus spp. plantations, although eucalypt plantations do share some borers in common with native forests. This chapter reviews the importance of these borers in Australian forests primarily from an economic perspective (i.e. those species that cause damage to commercial tree species) and highlights a paucity of native forest species that commonly kill trees relative to the large scales regularly seen in North America and Europe.

Some scientific questions can only be addressed with the involvement of a huge number of data collectors and analysers. The effort of such work based on professionals hampers the feasibility of some experiments. Consequently, involving volunteer citizens in monitoring and research programs (so called citizen science projects) is a growing activity in many countries and is expanding to new scientific areas.    International treaties such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species identify the necessity to evaluate change in the status and trends of global biodiversity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services also has as one of its four main functions to perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on biodiversity. Therefore, citizen science can be seen as a tool to monitor biodiversity change at regional and global level.    This thesis addresses five main research questions: What is the social context of a citizen science project and what points should be taken into consideration when designing a citizen science project?; What are the current and the potential benefits and limitations, for different citizen groups, in participating in a project of citizen science for registering biodiversity, using as a casestudy BioDiversity4All -a Portuguese biodiversity citizen science project?; What are the main intrinsic motivations to participate in citizen science projects?; What are the variables that drive the locations where users are making observations?; Can we use citizen science data to estimate climatic niches and species distributions?

Developing novel tools to control invasive species will benefit landholders and the environment, not just in Australia, but globally. Biocontrol of invasive plants via dieback causative agents is one such potential tool. Dieback causes a progressive reduction in plant population health, resulting in the death of plant parts and often complete plant death. It is prevalent in many invasive woody weeds in Australia and has been suggested as a potential mechanism for their biocontrol, particularly because local native plants appear unaffected.    Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Fabaceae; referred to hereafter as ""parkinsonia"") is an invasive tree in northern Australia, with native populations in South and Central America and southern USA. It is a perennial thorny shrub that forms dense thickets along waterways, floodplains and throughout paddocks, seriously impacting the pastoral industry, local biodiversity, and providing shelter to other invasive species such as feral pigs. Some Australian parkinsonia populations are affected by dieback, resulting in localised control. Despite previous and ongoing research, the cause of parkinsonia dieback remains elusive and dieback has not been observed in parkinsonia's native range. This thesis investigates the potential cause(s) of dieback in parkinsonia to contribute towards research on determining its suitability as a biological control tool. My goals were to describe the microbial endophytes of parkinsonia, identify correlations of microbial community composition and dieback occurrence, and identify patterns and pathogens that might be involved in dieback.    First, I analysed the community composition of archaeal, bacterial and fungal endophytes from the roots, stems and stem tips of healthy and dieback-affected parkinsonia. Samples were taken from Charters Towers in Queensland (QLD), Australia in May 2013. I used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis with taxon-specific primers for archaea, bacteria and fungi, followed by statistical analysis to determine how endophyte community composition relates to plant part and disease status. Archaeal and fungal community structures were significantly correlated with dieback occurrence and plant part. Bacterial community composition showed significant correlation to dieback occurrence but not plant part. The results showed that endophyte community composition in parkinsonia is associated with the occurrence of dieback and that endophyte communities vary across plants parts. I hypothesised that dieback occurrence may be due to the lack of potentially protective endophytes or the presence of putative pathogens.    As a complimentary study to the T-RFLP analysis, I used the same samples collected in QLD to characterise the culturable fungal endophyte communities in healthy and dieback-affected parkinsonia. I identified 219 isolates via amplicon sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to reveal a library of 54 unique species from 25 families. Eight isolates, identified as putative pathogens, were selected for a 10-week pathogenicity trial, including water stress treatments, on parkinsonia seedlings to determine whether inoculations of parkinsonia with these isolates would result in dieback-like symptoms, and whether stress due to drought or inundation enhanced these responses. Of the eight putative pathogenic isolates tested in the pathogenicity trial, inoculation with Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, Botryosphaeria dothidea and Pestalotiopsis mangiferae resulted in the largest lesions, but systemic infection or dieback-like symptoms were not observed, despite significant reductions in plant health due to water stress. As systemic infection or dieback symptoms were not observed, I determined that these pathogens are either not involved in parkinsonia dieback, that different or more extreme abiotic or biotic stress levels are required to trigger dieback-like symptoms, or that changes to the inoculation method are needed. Combining these factors will be essential in evaluating which factors are most important in initiating dieback in parkinsonia. Determining the cause of dieback in affected weeds may present land managers with a 'silver bullet' of biological control that could become a self-managed, perpetual instrument, reducing weed management costs and increasing biodiversity and land productivity. As such, future work in the use of dieback and host-specific phytopathogens for biological control of invasive plants should continue.",2017,28/2/2018 6:07,5/1/2021 5:59,,,224,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Western Sydney University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1983945623,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\VJJATRH4\Steinrucken - 2017 - Investigating the cause of dieback in the invasive.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

The need for precise and accurate results that are cost effective is important so that we can achieve our conservation goals. The overall aim of this study was to explore Next-Generation - metabarcoding for the detection of feral and native freshwater fish species based on the DNA shed by individual organisms into the water column. Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) primers were developed for this study using DNA from six freshwater species expected to be found in the waterbody. These primers, along with 16S rRNA (16S) primers, were assessed to ensure that the molecular method was robust and suitable for use in the field. Along with the cost effectiveness of the molecular method when compared to the more traditional surveying method of Fyke net surveying. This study comprised development of field and lab protocols for the detection of freshwater fish species in a lentic system. Both the COI and 16S primer sets showed results that were comparable to previous Fyke net surveys, though both primer sets detected species that the other did not. Further qPCR analysis showed that there were differences in detection for both primers for each of the species. The molecular surveying of the waterbody has been proven sensitive enough to detect Maccullochella peelii. This species has a very low abundance in the waterbody (believed to be n=1) so these results suggest that this method can be used to target low abundance species. The outcome of this study highlighted the need for multi-location sampling within a waterbody as increasing the number of locations sampled, led to an increase in the number of species detected. Along with the multi-location sampling, it was also important to sample throughout the year to account for seasonal variability. The eDNA study emphasized the importance of having knowledge of both the ecology and the biology of the species targeted so that a robust monitoring method can be implemented. As well as comparing the apparent accuracy of Fyke netting and the eDNA approach in the study waterbody, a cost benefit analysis comparing the relative costs of multiplex DNA surveying, single species molecular surveying, and Fyke net surveying was undertaken. Molecular environmental surveying was found to be a cost effective method for monitoring, as the analysis suggested single species monitoring would break even after only 95 waterbodies were surveyed, and multiplex surveying would break even after 145 waterbodies, under the proposed scenario. The cost benefit analysis explored the costs associated with all three methods, including lab set up costs, along with the number of waterbodies that could be surveyed on both a weekly and yearly basis.",2017,28/2/2018 6:07,15/3/2023 3:16,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,ECU,,not specified,,,,,GS 2017,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\5WKSAYJN\Biodiversity monitoring using environmental DN.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Central to these systems are nomenclatural and taxonomic mechanisms that validate, organize, and collocate data using established standards and classifications. This dissertation is about the identification, naming, control of, and access to, this cache of biodiversity knowledge, and the common information, documentation, and classification problems that materialize as part of this process. Invoking theories articulated in Information Studies, I examine how documentary control functions within the biodiversity environment, defined as it is by contingent concepts and documents, and how these disciplinary conditions negotiate this tension through classification structures. In particular, composite taxonomies are examined as authoritative access-oriented classifications designed predominantly to aggregate multiple biodiversity taxonomies under one management classification to facilitate efficient data communication. Such composite structures are situated in contradistinction to traditional, descriptive-based taxonomies, primarily designed to argue a hypothesis-driven position about how organisms are related. As constructed knowledge organization systems, biological classifications make implicit epistemological and ontological claims about biological facts, yet these attributes are often overlooked in the practice of interfacing with these systems. Given the increased prominence of these databases within scientific and professional communities, this dissertation asks what kind of knowledge these composite taxonomies instantiate and represent, and how successful they are in serving a consensus-based taxonomic purpose. Taking a critical Information Studies approach, these issues are explored by deeply analyzing the Catalogue of Life, a prominent composite taxonomic schema, invoking documentary, historical, and qualitative methodologies. This project critiques and illustrates the radiant effects of composite taxonomies in biodiversity networks and their multiple uses in professional and scientific practice. This manuscript argues all knowledge organization systems-biological and otherwise-are constructs of cultural and historical circumstances, manufactured artifacts of certain spatiotemporal positions. My goal is to show how other disciplines can inform the literature, theories, and work within Information Studies to rethink our problems anew. As I see it, the question is no longer whether our classification systems can attain true representational capacities, it is more about how we are going to acknowledge their constructedness and harness their contingencies for the most situated social benefit.",2017,21/1/2020 3:22,5/1/2021 5:52,,,342,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"University of California, Los Angeles",Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1917482232,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\NVZTBBXF\Montoya - 2017 - Contingent Consensus Documentary Control in Biodi.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

The Australian government has recognised the need to monitor conservation areas to mitigate human induced pressures on natural ecosystems. Anthropogenic climate change, altered fire regimes, isolation and management of exotic species are all threats to these ecosystems, compounded in sites that require revegetation such as Tilligerry Habitat State Reserve which was mined for minerals prior to 1971. Active rehabilitation efforts have been conducted at THA since original surveys were conducted in 1998. This survey looks at the current biodiversity of vegetation, birds and nocturnal fauna species within the Reserve to assess the progression of the site for conservation purposes. The survey used six plots to conduct vegetation and bird surveys to determine the characteristics of the vegetation communities and bird presence throughout the site. Three spotlighting transects were observed within the reserve to detect presence of nocturnal fauna. Data was analysed to determine species richness and similarity of species composition between plots and transect lines. Vegetation floristics and composition do not match projected communities, however this study showed a high species richness of both flora and birds and a low similarity of species presence between both plots and transects respectively. Low numbers of exotic species suggest effective weed control and adequate habitat for native species.

P6NUKXKZ,thesis,2017,"Fromont, Caroline","Molecular ecology, geography and species interactions of Mycopsylla insects with their bacterial endosymbionts, parasitoids and host fig trees",,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1943869389,"Mycopsylla fici Tryon (Hemiptera: Homotomidae) is a plant sap-feeding pest insect that can cause complete defoliation of its sole host tree species, Ficus macrophylla Desf. ex. Pers., the Moreton Bay fig. It has been suggested that M. fici outbreaks happen during hot and dry years (Newman 2004). Its host has two forms; F. macrophylla f. macrophylla is present on the mainland of Australia and F. macrophylla f. columnaris on Lord Howe Island (LHI), a volcanic remnant located ~600 km off the coast of New South Wales. Since the 19th century, this fig species has also been planted outside its natural range within Australia (e.g. Melbourne, Perth) and overseas in New Zealand (e.g. Auckland), Europe and USA. In Australia only one other species of Mycopsylla has been described. Mycopsylla proxima Froggatt feeds on Ficus rubiginosa Desf. ex. Vent., but has not yet been reported to cause significant defoliation. Interestingly, while at least one parasitoid species has been observed attacking M. fici in Australia, no Mycopsylla specific parasitoid species has been formally described in M. fici natural range. One parasitoid species, Psyllaephagus cornwallensis, has been described in New Zealand, where M. fici is an alien species. This thesis presents multiple aspects of the intra- and inter-specific genetic relationships of Mycopsylla. By integrating multiple trophic levels involving Mycopsylla species, I present an excellent model system to study evolutionary questions on relationships between insect hosts, their parasitoids and endosymbionts. The incorporation of different spatial scales revealed and contrasted dispersal abilities of interacting species. This work contributes to the understanding of the interactions and dispersal of a poorly-known pest species, whose potentially drought-induced major outbreaks may become more common in our changing environment.",2017,28/2/2018 6:03,5/1/2021 5:45,,,202,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Western Sydney University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1943869389,ProQuest,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\BR7GV62A\Fromont - 2017 - Molecular ecology, geography and species interacti.pdf",,2 - ALA cited

XE5N7W5G,thesis,2017,"Correia, Barbara dos Santos",Linking Omics and Ecophysiology in Eucalyptus: Unravelling Stress Tolerance in a Forest Species,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2036308618?accountid=26957,"Eucalyptus plantations are among the most productive forest stands worldwide. In Portugal and Spain, they are widely used for pulp production and as an energy crop. However, the region's Mediterranean climate, with increasingly severe summer drought, negatively affects eucalypt growth and increases mortality. The aim of this doctoral thesis was to unravel drought tolerance in Eucalyptus globulus by investigating and interconnecting information on the processes mediating water deficit and rehydration, from gene and molecular regulation to physiological responses and plant performance, using two different genotypes and different stress trials. The thesis disclosed herein is presented in a series of research papers (chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5), preceded by a general introduction (chapter 1) and closed with concluding remarks (chapter 6). Chapter 2 describes a greenhouse trial and a slowly imposed water deficit, and is divided into three subchapters. Two genotypes (AL-18 and AL-10) were submitted to a 3-week water stress period at two different intensities (18% and 25% of field capacity), followed by 1 week of rewatering. Recovery was assessed 1 day and 1 week after rehydration. Several phytohormones were monitored in leaves, xylem sap and roots, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 168 h after rewatering. Water deficit reduced height, biomass, water potential, and gas exchange. Contrarily, the levels of pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and MDA increased. ABA and ABA-GE levels increased, and JA content decreased in leaves and increased in xylem sap. During recovery, most of the physiological and biochemical responses of stressed plants were reversed. Comparative proteome (using difference gel electrophoresis) and metabolome (using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) analyses enabled the separation and isolation of 2031 peptide spots, 217 of which were identified, and the detection of 121 polar metabolites. The analysis of the resilient clone AL-18, which presented a response network very distinct from the responsive clone AL-10, reinforced the role of specific photosynthetic and defence-related proteins as key players in mediating drought tolerance and revealed new players: glutamine synthetase, malate dehydrogenase and isoflavone reductase-like protein. Chapter 3 regards a climate chamber trial and a sudden water shortage, and is divided in two subchapters. The relative expression of 12 transcripts was analysed by quantitative PCR in two clones with different degrees of tolerance (AL-18 and AL-13) 7 and 11 days after water withholding and rehydration (2 h and 3 days after rewatering). Sudden water shortage was more detrimental to the plants than when slowly imposed, with heavier outcomes in clone AL-13, including plant death. Potential molecular indicators linked to enhanced water stress tolerance in Eucalyptus globulus were identified: rubisco activase (RCA), ferredoxin-NADP(H) oxireductase (FNR), mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH), peroxisomal catalase (CAT) and isoflavone reductase (IFR). Afterwards, several biochemical markers of oxidative stress and DNA methylation patterns were quantified in the leaves of AL-18. The alterations detected using global and specific indicators reflected the parallel induction of redox and complex DNA methylation changes occurring during stress imposition and relief. Chapter 4 reports a field trial: the previously identified set of indicators for selection of water stress tolerance was tested in field-grown AL-18 and AL-13. Some of the plants were irrigated (IR), and others were left under environmental conditions of reduced rainfall (NI) during six and a half weeks prior to rewatering. Clone AL-18 showed few fluctuations in the conditions tested, and the alterations found in clone AL-13 highlighted an induction of photosynthetic and photorespiration metabolism after artificial rehydration. The results corroborated that responses to field conditions cannot be extrapolated from a stress applied individually in the context of developing selection markers. Chapter 5 describes a climate chamber trial that tested the isolated and combined effect of drought and heat. Physiological, biochemical and metabolomic alterations were monitored in AL-18 after a 5-day of consistent drought and/or 4 h at 40ºC. Testing drought-stressed plants subject to a heat shock revealed a decrease in gas exchange, Ψpd and JA, no alterations in electrolyte leakage, MDA, starch and pigments and increased glutathione pool in relation to control. The induction of cinnamate was a novel response triggered only by the combined stress. These results highlighted that the combination of drought and heat provides significant protection from more detrimental effects of drought-stressed eucalypts, confirming that combined stresses alter plant metabolism in a novel manner that cannot be extrapolated by the sum of the different stresses applied individually. This thesis describes a number of biological responses that enable E. globulus to thrive under conditions of water deficit and provides useful information of pathways to be explored in order to find suitable markers of abiotic stress tolerance in this species. Despite that, a bigger challenge remains and consists of the need to focus our studies in more realistic, field-like experiments, at least in the context of finding suitable selection markers in the climate change era.   Alternate abstract:As plantacoes de eucalipto estao entre as mais produtivas do mundo inteiro. Em Portugal e Espanha, sao amplamente utilizadas na producao de polpa e como fonte de energia. No entanto, o clima mediterranico da regiao, com secas de verao cada vez mais severas, afeta negativamente o crescimento do eucalipto e aumenta a sua mortalidade. Esta tese de doutoramento tem como objetivo desvendar a tolerancia a seca da especie Eucalyptus globulus, investigando e interligando informacao dos processos que medeiam o defice hidrico e a reidratacao, desde a regulacao genetica e molecular ate as respostas fisiologicas e desempenho da planta, utilizando dois genotipos distintos e diferentes ensaios experimentais. Esta tese esta estruturada sob a forma de estudos cientificos (capitulos 2, 3, 4 e 5), precedidos por uma introducao geral (capitulo 1), e termina com as notas finais (capitulo 6). O capitulo 2 descreve um ensaio de estufa e um defice hidrico imposto lentamente, e esta dividido em 3 subcapitulos. Dois genotipos (AL-18 e AL-10) foram sujeitos a um periodo de stress hidrico de 3 semanas com duas intensidades diferentes (18% e 25% da capacidade de campo), seguido de uma semana de reidratacao. A recuperacao foi avaliada um dia e uma semana depois da reidratacao. Varias fitohormonas foram monitorizadas nas folhas, seiva xilemica e raizes, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h e 168 h depois da reidratacao. A falta de agua reduziu a altura, a biomassa, o potencial hidrico e as trocas gasosas. Pelo contrario, os niveis de pigmentos, parametros da fluorescencia da clorofila e MDA aumentaram. Os niveis de ABA e de ABA-GE aumentaram, enquanto o JA diminuiu nas folhas e aumentou na seiva xilemica. Durante a recuperacao, a maioria das alteracoes fisiologicas e bioquimicas provocadas pelo stress reverteram. Analises comparativas do proteoma (analisado por eletroforese em gel diferencial) e do metaboloma (analisado por cromatografia gasosa com espetrometria de massa) permitiram a separacao de 2031 pontos peptidicos, dos quais 217 foram identificados, e a detecao de 121 metabolitos polares. A analise do clone resiliente AL-18, que apresentou uma rede de resposta bem distinta do clone responsivo AL-10, reforcou o papel de proteinas especificas da fotossintese e relacionadas com a defesa como intermediarios chave na tolerancia a seca e revelou novos intermediarios: glutamina sintetase, malato desidrogenase e isoflavona redutase. O capitulo 3 diz respeito a um ensaio em camara climatica e a uma rapida escassez de agua, e esta dividido em 2 subcapitulos. A expressao relativa de 12 transcritos foi analisada por PCR quantitativo em dois clones com diferentes graus de tolerancia (AL-18 e AL-13) depois de 7 e 11 dias sem qualquer rega e posterior reidratacao. A rapida escassez de agua foi mais prejudicial para as plantas do que o defice hidrico imposto lentamente, com maior visibilidade no clone AL-13 que revelou morte de algumas plantas. Indicadores moleculares potencialmente ligados a uma tolerancia aumentada foram identificados: rubisco ativase (RCA), ferredoxina-NADP(H) oxidorredutase (FNR), malato desidrogenase mitocondrial (mMDH) catalase peroxissomal (CAT) e isoflavona redutase (IFR). De seguida, varios marcadores bioquimicos de stress oxidativo e padroes de metilacao do DNA foram quantificados nas folhas do clone AL-18. As alteracoes detetadas utilizando indicadores globais e especificos refletiram a inducao de complexas modificacoes redox e de metilacao do DNA, que ocorrem paralelamente durante a imposicao e interrupcao do stress. O capitulo 4 reporta um ensaio de campo: o conjunto de indicadores de selecao de tolerancia hidrica identificado anteriormente foi testado em AL-18 e AL-13 plantados no campo. Algumas das plantas foram regadas artificialmente (IR) e outras foram deixadas nas condicoes ambientais de precipitacao reduzida (NI) durante seis semanas e meia antes de voltar a regar. O clone AL-18 mostrou pouca variacao nas condicoes testadas, e as alteracoes encontradas no clone AL-13 realcaram a inducao do metabolismo fotossintetico e fotorespiratorio apos a reidratacao artificial. Estes resultados mostraram que as respostas das plantas no campo nao podem ser extrapoladas a partir do estudo de um stress aplicado individualmente, particularmente no contexto de encontrar marcadores de selecao. O capitulo 5 descreve um ensaio em camara climatica que testou o efeito isolado e combinado de seca e calor. Alteracoes fisiologicas, bioquimicas e metabolomicas foram monitorizadas no clone AL-18 apos 5 dias de seca consistente e/ou 4 h a 40ºC. Testar plantas em stress hidrico sujeitas a um choque termico revelou uma diminuicao das trocas gasosas, do potencial hidrico e do JA, nenhum efeito a nivel da perda de eletrolitos, MDA, amido e pigmentos e um aumento na glutationa, em comparacao com condicoes controlo. O stress combinado induziu tambem a producao do cinamato, uma resposta nova. Estes resultados realcam que a combinacao de seca e calor fornece uma protecao significante contra os efeitos mais prejudiciais da seca isolada em eucalipto, confirmando que o stress combinado altera o metabolismo das plantas de uma forma nova que nao pode ser extrapolada pela soma dos diferentes stresses aplicados individualmente. Esta tese descreve um conjunto de respostas biologicas que permitem ao eucalipto manter-se em condicoes de defice hidrico e revela informacao util de varias vias metabolicas a serem exploradas de modo a encontrar marcadores de tolerancia ao stress abiotico apropriados. Apesar disso, um desafio maior permanece. Consiste na necessidade de focarmos os nossos estudos em experiencias mais realistas, que mimetizem as condicoes de campo, pelo menos no contexto de encontrarmos marcadores de selecao ajustados a uma era de alteracoes climaticas.",2017,21/1/2020 3:22,5/1/2021 5:39,,,216,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Universidade de Aveiro (Portugal),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,2036308618,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\PIDXDIU8\Correia - 2017 - Linking Omics and Ecophysiology in Eucalyptus Unr.pdf,,2 - ALA cited
4ZX9YR6F,thesis,2017,"Bickerstaff, James Ronald Munro","Morphological and Molecular Characterisation of Australian Pinhole Borers (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Platypodinae)",,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1983422675?accountid=26957,"Pinhole borers (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Platypodinae) are ecologically important and evolutionary unique taxa of economic significance. They are the oldest known insect lineage that cultivates fungi, commonly referred to as ambrosia fungi, within galleries excavated into the heartwood of trees. Most species of pinhole borers inhabit dead or dying trees, however, several species attack living trees, which can have detrimental effects on these hosts. For example, wilt disease is a common disease of trees caused by fungal pathogens transmitted by some pinhole borer species. These beetle species inoculate fungal pathogens into tree hosts and this can lead to tree mortality. Not all pinhole borer species that attack living trees carry fungi that cause disease, but their tunnelling and fungiculture can still have adverse effects on tree vigour and timber quality. Despite the importance of pinhole borers, ecological information pertaining to this group is scarce and species identification is difficult due to highly conserved morphologies across species. This Master of Research project will help bridge this gap by reviewing the taxonomy, systematics, and biogeography of previously collected Australian Platypodinae and systematically characterise common DNA barcoding sequences.    This project investigated the biogeography, host tree associations, and morphological diversity of Australian pinhole borers. This has culminated in comprehensive distribution maps for recorded and collected specimens of 25 species in Australia, as well as the distribution of their respective host trees. An electronic identification key of 37 Australasian pinhole borers, Australian native species and commonly intercepted species, was also developed, the first of its kind for this group of beetles. Additionally, a molecular study was performed on 98 individuals of 31 Australian pinhole borer morphospecies. Mitochondrial COI and nuclear 28S rDNA loci were amplified and sequenced, resulting in novel COI DNA barcodes for seven species, and new 28S rDNA sequences for six other species. Using these loci, in conjunction with published data, the systematics of Australian Platypodinae was explored and contextualised with species previously described from across the globe. Phylogenetic analyses of both loci were congruent with previous systematic and evolutionary investigations; however, the Platypus genus remained unresolved due to its polyphyletic status. This result highlights the need for further taxonomic work on Platypus, and on Platypodinae more broadly. Finally, results obtained in this study are discussed in a global context, and recommendations for future studies are outlined.",2017,28/2/2018 6:02,5/1/2021 5:38,,,164,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Western Sydney University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,M.Res.,,1983422675,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\EWBYIDPM\Bickerstaff - 2017 - Morphological and Molecular Characterisation of Au.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

8JBBD7CD,report,2017,"Hall, M R; Motti, C A; Kroon, F","The potential role of the giant triton snail, Charonia tritonis (Gastropoda: Ranellidae) in mitigating populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish",,,,,,"This report reviews existing and historical literature on the biology and ecology of the giant triton, Charonia tritonis, in the context of their potential role in mitigating periodic outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS), Acanthaster planci species complex, and in particular A. cf. solaris on the Great Barrier Reef. Based on the available information, it is not possible to conclude whether giant tritons are rare due to natural causes or due to their historical exploitation. If the latter they may have been pushed to a tipping point and been unable to recolonise previous habitats. Prospects for captive rearing and release are examined with the intention to develop recommendations about future research and management directions with respect to their application in CoTS mitigation. The various hypotheses to account for periodic outbreaks of CoTS, including the 'predator removal' and 'adult aggregation' hypotheses, are discussed in the context of integrated pest management of CoTS. To this end, the fundamental aspects of predator ecology in marine benthic ecosystems are outlined. Importantly, primary drivers are not necessarily just those associated with direct predation/consumption of prey but rather the very presence of predators. Predators can induce 'landscapes of fear' via trait-mediated indirect interactions, often regulated by chemoreception, and are being increasingly applied in biological control scenarios. The 'zone of impact' of these signals can extend some distance from the primary source; therefore the mere presence of the predator may be of critical importance when establishing biological control programs. The predatory giant triton is an echinoderm specialist with a preference for asteroids including CoTS, as observed on the Great Barrier Reef and in controlled feeding studies. However, confident evaluation of their impact on the populations of CoTS and other echinoderms requires further research. In the laboratory, CoTS express a clear alarm response to C. tritonis, however, little is known of the specificity of this response and whether other putative prey species express similar behaviour. Charonia tritonis have been bred in captivity. Although the planktonic larvae were held for ~300 days none completed the larval cycle to settlement and metamorphosis. A critical bottleneck to their successful aquaculture is the lack of understanding of the processes and chemical factors that induce and coordinate settlement. With recent advances in genomic techniques the sensory biology of C. tritonis larvae could be probed potentially revealing the chemoreceptors and chemical cues involved. As large slow moving predators, giant tritons could be deployed at specific reefs on an ad hoc basis to predate and/or disperse CoTS. Alternatively, chemicals that comprise the giant triton's exosecretome could be released to create a landscape of fear. Reefs established as outbreak initiation zones could be preferentially targeted, potentially disrupting/interfering the formation of pre-spawning aggregations, which are crucial to fertilisation success of CoTS, ultimately reducing the severity of outbreaks.",2017,17/7/2018 23:51,23/3/2023 23:51,,65,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Cairns, Australia",English,,,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\AXGILFLG\Hall et al. - The potential role of the giant triton snail, Char.pdf",,2 - ALA cited

Whilst data owning culture in our institutional settings seems to hinder truly interdisciplinary research, the emergence of Linked Open Data implies the increasing opportunities of distributed-data research. This article is based on an API application to address those issues in the context of Open Data. James Cook Dynamic Journal was created to assist users to study the Cook's journal, integrating various sets of APIs which facilitate full-text search, Named Entity Recognition, and map views. The development revealed some critical issues of data federation and processing automation. The standardization of data structure and the development of user-friendly GUI tools would significantly increase the value of APIs.

The new data portal of CRBio includes 5,000 species pages, more than 50,000 images, and around seven million georeferenced occurrence records. The occurrence records are part of more than 800 databases and were published by research centers located in 33 countries.

ADD2BH25,conferencePaper,2017,"Low-Choy, S.; Huijbers, C.",Experimenting with Modelling via a Virtual Laboratory: Evaluating pseudo-absence strategies to refine a species distribution model,,,,10.36334/modsim.2017.g8.lowchoy,http://hdl.handle.net/10072/374578,"Virtual laboratories (VLs) are fast becoming realities in many fields of enquiry. For instance, the  Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL) provides users with a high-performance computational  platform to enable more efficient investigation of biological systems. This kind of VL is more than  a mere portal to dispersed data sources and a diverse range of modelling options; it also reduces computational  overheads and tedium required to implement models. In this way, a VL allows users to explore each model to  more fully apply scientific method in model development. Here we explore how the BCCVL can be used to  support an iterative process of investigating and refining models, through experimentation.  The BCCVL supports many kinds of modelling for biodiversity, measured by species presence, traits or aggregate  measures such as species richness. Here we narrow our focus to consider species distribution modelling  (SDM), and in particular, the source of absence data. Absences in SDM provide a useful case study  for exploring models in VLs, as there are many potential settings, known to substantially impact SDM results.  When absence of the species has not been explicitly recorded, several strategies are available to impute  'pseudo-absences'. New users may inadvertently specify pseudo-absences in a way that leads to issues such as  'naughty noughts' or pseudo-replication. It is possible to identify those issues during SDM, and this process  can be accelerated through a VL. Additionally after initial exploration in a VL, it is easy to export data for  analysis into a statistical package, such as R, and continue to refine SDMs.  Here we show how the SDM for the Golden bowerbird is sensitive to the strategy for generating pseudoabsences,  as defined by settings that can be altered within the BCCVL. A sequence of well-defined experiments  gradually helps refine the options defining this strategy. We begin with the study region, which implicitly delimits  search effort, and potentially defined by: the continent, a bioregion or a convex hull delimited by the  farthest occurrences. At the same time BCCVL makes it easy to compare SDM algorithms. We consider  regression (GLM), tree (CTA) and machine learning (MaxEnt) algorithms. Next we undertake separate experiments  to further refine selection of pseudo-absences. The sampling strategy may be: completely random;  constrained by a disc centred at occurrences; or defined by a Surface Range Envelope, comprising locations  that fall outside the usual range of predictors evaluated at occurrences. In comparison to the number of occurrences,  the intensity of pseudo-absences may be set to be equal or any other ratio. We export model results for  out-of-VL analysis, and apply recursive partitioning trees in R to investigate naughty noughts.  The Golden bowerbird is similar to many specialist species in Australia: generating pseudo-absences across  the continent gave a large contrast between occurrence and absence, as evidenced by the distribution of predicted  probability of presences. Constraining pseudo-absences to a bioregion, we were able to choose an SDM  algorithm that permitted examination of gradients from absence to presence, whilst retaining high accuracy.  Further experimentation assessed sensitivity to the sampling strategy of pseudo-absences, with a good option  being a 10:1 sampling ratio at least 10km from occurrences. Exporting these pseudo-absences to R, tree modelling  identified uninhabited climates (with high mean temperature of the warmest quarter). When omitted,  the estimates of climate effects on this species' presence were greatly sharpened. This demonstrates how a VL  may be used to refine modelling, evaluating sensitivity to settings via performance measures relevant at each  stage. In this case the choice of pseudo-absence strategy to support SDM for the Golden bowerbird might have  been discarded using a 'one-off' modelling approach that focussed on a single indicator.",2017,17/5/2018 6:27,5/1/2021 3:33,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand,"Hobart, Tasmania, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2018,,10.36334/modsim.2017.g8.lowchoy,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\VXU44HF6\Low-Choy and Huijbers - 2017 - Experimenting with Modelling via a Virtual Laborat.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Here we present the first collated AusPlots dataset and overview the sampling of environments (e.g. a rainfall gradient of 129-1437 mm Mean Annual Precipitation) and vegetation. Over 3,000 vascular plant taxa in 22 major vegetation types including savanna, eucalypt woodland, chenopod shrubland and grassland have been recorded in these 442 field plots. The core field module of AusPlots is a point intercept survey, which records substrate, plant species, growth form and height at each of 1010 intercepts located along 10 transects arranged in a grid within 1 ha plots. Comprehensive plant species diversity is also recorded through systematic vouchering and formal identification, making the data robust to identification error and taxonomic change. Standardised and quantitative data combined with open access data publication via AEKOS, plus a broad spatial scope, make this a useful dataset for applications such as analysis of vegetation cover (by species, growth form or fractional cover) and species composition modelling. The data are already being used to validate remotely sensed information, including fractional cover products and estimates of tree and forest cover in drylands based on visual interpretation of satellite imagery.

As part of this initiative, the South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR) has been commissioned to collate and ground-truth baseline groundwater, surface water and ecology information in regions with the potential for CSG and large coal mining development. The Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) is a priority bioregional area of assessment. As such, a key project within the broader program involving data acquisition is the LEB Springs Assessment (LEBSA). The LEBSA focuses on groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) of the regions encompassing the Galilee, Cooper, Arckaringa and Pedirka basins. The aim is to provide the Office of Water Science with aligned data management tools that can be used across sub-regions and across both South Australia and Queensland. To achieve this outcome the following was undertaken:  Audit of existing water and ecological data  Gap analysis  Development of an aligned data model for GAB springs across South Australia and Queensland. More accurate mapping of GAB springs and detailed investigations in priority regions (Gotch et al. 2016; Keppel et al. 2015, 2016) has been undertaken and data results have been integrated so that standardised data can be accessed in the future. Within South Australia this database platform will access biological data stored in the Biological Databases of SA (BDBSA), and hydrogeology and geomorphology data from within the SA groundwater database - SA Geodata. Ultimately the amassed data sets will be used to undertake impact and risk assessments for the cumulative and individual impacts of CSG and coal mining activities on the GAB springs.

We are impressed with the progress that OEH has made towards this goal. However, we do not feel that the Biodiversity Assessment Method (BAM) in its current form is yet to fully meet all of the proposed aims, of the forthcoming Biodiversity Offsets Scheme. Key strengths of the draft BAM are:  We strongly support the move to a unified assessment methodology.  Splitting the assessment methodology into two documents (an explanatory document and a manual) improves clarity.  The approaches for scoring Vegetation integrity are innovative and draw on best science.  In our opinion, guidelines developed for avoiding impacts as part of the mitigation hierarchy represent best practice in Australia.  Metrics are generally simple and easy to understand.  Identifying 'red lights' or thresholds beyond which impacts cannot be offset is supported. The key issues we have identified are:  The BAM is still very much in draft form. Key information is still missing. It will require several iterations to be sufficiently unambiguous and organised to be suitable for release. This is a very large undertaking so a considerable investment of resources will be required.  Different assessment pathways for scattered trees, small trees, small areas and linear developments should be part of the BAM.  The BAM and requirements for the Biodiversity Assessment Report (BAR) are too onerous to represent a streamlined assessment methodology for clearing applications. For example, we consider the requirement to undertake full-floristic mapping of Plant Community Types (PCTs) to be an undesirable goal within the context of a development application. A fasttracked exercise to complete mapping of PCTs would be beneficial to a streamlined assessment method.  Various proposed options for metrics within the BAM can only be fully evaluated using a sensitivity analysis based on real, or where this does not exist, simulated data.  We consider that the metrics used to calculate Ecosystem credits, combined with liberal offsetting rules, are likely to encourage offsets in relatively intact areas of NSW, rather than degraded areas. This could result in relatively modest marginal gains in biodiversity relative to existing biodiversity.  Criteria used to identify thresholds beyond which impacts cannot be offset are not sufficiently documented.  On balance we feel that the right balance between flexibility and out-of-kind offsets has not been found: there is too much emphasis on the latter.  The BAM lacks clear standards indicating when an offset is not acceptable. Insufficient information was provided in the version of the draft BAM we reviewed to assess whether predicted gains in biodiversity values at an offset site adequately include measures that explicitly consider time lags, uncertainty and risk, as per the terms of reference.",2015,28/2/2018 5:36,23/3/2023 9:02,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,landmanagement.nsw.gov.au,Australia,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\HYVKNALQ\Gibbons and Eyre - 2015 - DRAFT Independent review of the Biodiversity Asses.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

FIKB7Y28,report,2015,"Casanova, M.T.",Review of Water Requirements for Key Floodplain Vegetation for the Northern Basin: Literature review and expert knowledge assessment.,,,,,https://www.mdba.gov.au/publications/independent-reports/review-water-requirements-key-floodplain-vegetation-northern-basin,"This Review of Water Requirements for Key Floodplain Vegetation for the Northern Basin was undertaken by botanist Dr Michelle Casanova as part of the Northern Basin Review. This report summarises the best available knowledge on the water requirements of key floodplain species, as at September 2015. The knowledge was obtained by: • searching relevant databases to find all the available published and unpublished information to capture the latest and most relevant scientific knowledge to complement previous reports, particularly Roberts and Marston (2011 see table E1); and • face to face and telephone interviews with experts, and a workshop with 18 botanical experts working across the Murray-Darling Basin so that the expert knowledge of scientists monitoring these species could be taken into account. Draft findings were then reviewed by experts prior to the finalisation of the report. Floodplain vegetation comprises species that require more water than falls on them as rain alone, but for which permanent inundation is lethal. The distribution of water in the landscape and the way that water is delivered in riparian zones, influences plant survival and reproduction, and ultimately their position in the landscape. Times of drought and flooding influence life-history events (e.g. reproduction, growth) and condition in these species. Different life-history events require specific amounts of water or components of the flow regime. A species 'water requirements' refers to the quantity, quality and timing of water needed to complete its life history. For riparian and floodplain species this is largely provided by flow along the river and associated riparian-zone ground water. Collectively the depth, duration, frequency and timing of water delivery (or availability, from all sources) in riparian and wetland systems is described by the term 'water regime'. The review focuses on five floodplain plant species - River Red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens), Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah), River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) and Lignum (Duma florulenta). These are all important species on the floodplains of rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin. However, these five are only a few of the species that occur in that habitat. Other tree, herbaceous, grassy, and shrubby species make up the vegetation that occurs on floodplains and in riparian zones. These other species also require water and respond to flow. Understanding how the key plant species use water at different stages of their life cycles, and how this changes in relation to tree condition can help inform strategies for delivery of the water regime that is needed to sustain those species (i.e. how often, how much, for how long, and when). Providing water for the key species can also provide water for the rest of the vegetation, particularly if plant species can be categorised into groups with specific water regime requirements. Provision of water for plants can provide water for the whole ecosystem. This review contains detailed information about the water requirements of the five species. Some species like River Red gum and Black box are well-studied, so we understand their life history constraints, condition thresholds and the water requirements of populations. For the other species (Coolibah, River Cooba and Lignum) there have been fewer published studies, so the interview and workshop process was important for discovering information for those species. To the extent that it is available, science from the northern Murray-Darling Basin has been incorporated into this review. Appropriately, this knowledge has been complemented with studies from the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin where gaps in knowledge existed.",2015,28/2/2018 5:36,23/3/2023 9:11,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Charophyte Services,"Lake Bolac, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\NUX9Q7ZU\Casanova - 2015 - Review of Water Requirements for Key Floodplain Ve.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

While fundamentally opposing values cannot easily be resolved, progress has been made in developing GIS planning tools that provide a common ground for analysis of scenarios and options. However, the complexity of integrating models across disciplines such as hydrology and ecology poses a considerable challenge. This paper describes a GIS tool that highlights priority areas for biodiversity conservation and water provisioning services and then integrates both to characterize water provisioning ecosystem services (WPES). Biodiversity conservation priority areas were modelled with the spatial prioritization tool Zonation, and water provisioning services were assessed based on runoff, flow path length and the presence of vegetation. Zonation produces prioritisation in a balanced manner that maximises high quality habitats for all biodiversity features (e.g. species) in accordance to their rarity. The top priorities typically represent the full range of regional biodiversity within a relatively small area. These priorities were derived from spatial data describing the distribution of biodiversity features, including flora and fauna species and endangered ecological communities. Water provisioning services were calculated through modelling flow length with a digital elevation model in combination with runoff and spatial data on vegetation cover. Areas with longer flow length, in areas with higher runoff and vegetation cover, have higher values for water provisioning services. Spatial data for biodiversity and water provision services were then combined using a stream network to characterize the value of runoff generating areas in terms of their contribution to downstream riparian biodiversity. A case study of land use planning in the Greater Hunter region, a mining and agricultural area of New South Wales, Australia, is used to demonstrate our approach to quantifying WPES. The impacts of potential future locations of surface coal mining were assessed by examining the spatial overlap of a coal seam geological layer with WPES. Our analysis identified areas that have high WPES value that may be affected by mining in the future. The aim of this research is not to present an end-point for a planning process but to demonstrate the value of and ways forward for incorporating system interactions by combining outputs of modelling tools. We conclude by discussing future research and the challenge of considering jointly water impacts and biodiversity impacts, including the need to evaluate interactions among the various GIS layers.",2015,28/2/2018 6:05,6/3/2023 6:26,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,Gold Coast,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,10.36334/modsim.2015.f10.lechner,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QVCMHNTC\Lechneretal._2015_AGIStoolforlandandwaterusepl.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

The ocelli are single-lens eyes of the camera type, whose role is still unknown in many insects, including the studied species. The present study searched for a potential role of these visual organs in these species, by determining the physiological and optical characteristics of the ocelli. Because of their different life styles (migratory vs. non-migratory), we searched to see if any differences are found and if the roles of the ocelli may differ as well. In my thesis I have found that these species have two underfocused ocelli placed laterally on the vertex of the head, close to the dorsal margin of the compound eyes and posterior to the antennae. The lenses are smooth with no pronounced asymmetry and astigmatism. The projection fields from the Bogong ocellar neurons are located close to the posterior brain surface, adjacent to the esophageal hole, anterior to the mushroom body calyx and anterior of the central complex.

Fungi regulate the biosphere and support the earth's ecological functioning. Yet the exceptionally few mushrooms with the capacity to dismantle human livers and kidneys have received disproportionate attention. This thesis presents an account of human-fungus relationships and how fungi are perceived and understood. It uses fungi as a lens to reconfigure ways of thinking, not just about fungi, but all nature, including Homo sapiens. It expands on the dominant mycological narratives through which fungi are represented, to create space for other forms of knowledge that allow these marginalised organisms to emerge through the cracks of human awareness and concern.    The research had a threefold aim: first, to understand why fungi are regarded differently to other organisms. Second, to present a more inclusive concept of fungi by proposing a shift in thinking-from thinking of sporebodies as discrete entities, to considering fungi as sophisticated relational systems relevant to human lives. Third, I examined what is required to enable their inclusion within what is valued; including within concepts of nature, biodiversity and conservation. This means finding ways to insert fungi into the ecological imagination and consciousness.    Through interactions with all sorts of 'fungal folk,' I elucidated the differences between definitive and expansive perceptions of nature and how the manifest indeterminacy of fungal development highlights the need for broader perceptions and an enhanced language. Fungus reproductive structures such as mushrooms provide a tangible link to humanity. However, I argued that mycelia provide a more imaginative and insightful way to consider the bigger fungal picture. Mycelia provide a matrix of interconnectivity with organisms and environments across multiple temporal and spatial scales, underpinning ideas of interactions and circulations explored throughout this thesis. I examined how the plastic essentiality of mycelia-versatility, complexity, heterogeneity, changeability, resilience, indeterminacy and biological utility-offers a compelling and constructive framework to contemplate the living world. The mycelial tangle also provides metaphors for human societies; for connectivity, spontaneity, unpredictability and ways to attune to the dynamism of natural systems that move beyond ideas of balance and control.    The thesis is brought together through a collection of voices in stories and anecdotes, histories and science, gleaned across hemispheres and cultures. It comes alive particularly through direct engagement with people and fungi in their habitats. It is embedded in the sensorial as much as the philosophical; through sensing fungi and their places during my thousand days in the forest. Through a combination of text and visual essays working in counterpoint, I reflected on how aesthetic, sensate experience deepened by scientific knowledge offers a rich understanding of fungi, the forest and human interactions.    At a time when Australia is shifting from a traditionally mycophobic position towards greater interest in fungi, new questions arise about their place in the living world.

A4RTR4TU,thesis,2016,"Ong, J.","In bed with viruses: The partnership between orchids, fungi and viruses",,,,,http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/37275/,"The Orchidaceae is the largest and most diverse angiosperm family comprising of five subfamilies, over 800 genera and over 26,000 species. In Western Australia, there are over 450 indigenous orchid species across 40 genera, concentrated predominately within the South West Australian Floristic Region, but with a few species in the tropical Kimberley. The southern species are all terrestrial and most belong to the Diurideae tribe, which are primarily restricted to Australia and New Zealand. To varying degrees, orchids rely on associations with other organisms, particularly fungi for nutrient provision and insects for pollination. The partnerships between the orchids, their fungal symbionts and insect pollinators are quite well studied in some cases. However, the ecological influence of viruses, in particular indigenous viruses, within these symbiotic partnerships remains largely unexplored. Orchids cultivated for their flowers or vanilla are frequently infected by viruses, which are spread from plant to plant by vectors, husbandry tools and through vegetative propagation, and from place to place in infected propagules by trade. Only recently have wild orchids been shown to also harbour viruses. In this research, we used a combination of high throughput sequencing approach, traditional techniques and informatics to examine the leaf tissues of indigenous terrestrial orchid plants growing in their natural habitats for virus infection. Further, we isolated fungi that form mycorrhizal associations within cortical root cells of these plants and examined them for the presence of viruses. Terrestrial orchids and their fungal symbionts were sampled from 17 species across six genera (Caladenia, Diuris, Drakaea, Microtis, Paraceleana and Pterostylis) during the winter (June to August) and spring (September to November) growing seasons. This study represents the first of viruses from the indigenous orchids and fungal species examined. Thirty-two viruses, representing seven viral families and eight genera (Alphapartitivirus, Betapartitivirus, Endornavirus, Goravirus, Hypovirus, Mitovirus, Platypuvirus and Totivirus), were identified and characterised from wild plants of Drakaea, Microtis and Pterostylis orchids and their fungal symbionts. Four of the viruses were identified from leaves of Drakaea species and Pterostylis sanguinea orchids and the remaining 28 viruses were from six isolates of orchid mycorrhizal fungi of the genus Ceratobasidium. All but one of the viruses found were novel, and most were from taxonomic groups not previously described in the Australian continent. In three Ceratobasidium isolates studied, there were 5-13 virus species present in each. The presence of several closely-related bi-partite partitiviruses within the one host presented challenges in determining the numbers of species present and accurate pairing of virus segments. This study proposes solutions to address these problems, which will no doubt also arise in future metagenomics studies. Two of the new viruses described formed the bases of new genera (Goravirus and Platypuvirus), while other viruses could be tentatively classified within known taxa, but were often genetically divergent from existing members. For example, two novel partitiviruses represent a lineage basal to existing members of Alphapartitivirus, pointing to Australia as an important location in partitivirus evolution. The richness and uniqueness of viruses found in this study are likely a reflection of the orchid and fungal diversity of the region, itself a consequence of over 25 million years of relative geological and climatic stability. The surprisingly high numbers of mycoviruses detected from only a few fungal samples indicate that there is a rich virus association with fungal component of orchid biology and that orchid flora might represent a potentially enormous reservoir of novel viruses.",2016,28/2/2018 6:06,15/3/2023 2:43,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Murdoch University,,not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\IWBVEDRH\Ong - 2016 - In bed with viruses The partnership between orchi.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

HFYN7Q5Y,thesis,2016,"Mancera Alarcon, K. F.","Effects of anthropogenic noise on the behaviour, physiological traits and welfare of two animal models: wild mice (Mus musculus) and Eastern blue tongued lizard ...",,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:383366,"Noise is an important source of stress that is able to impact negatively on animals' welfare. Anthropogenic activities are a major contributor to noise, and their cumulative effects on individuals could have consequences for wildlife populations. Although transportation noise impacts have been evaluated for vocal and charismatic animals, research regarding the effects of other types of anthropogenic noise on non-charismatic animals has not been undertaken. This research explored the effects of mining noise, which is prevalent in the Australian soundscape, on wild mice (Mus musculus) and Eastern blue tongued lizards (Tiliqua scincoides). The first experimental stage focused on developing a reliable methodology to assess behavioural responses in the blue tongued lizard, and suitable noise exposure and acoustic processing techniques for subsequent experimentation. This was achieved through the analysis of the effects of typical transport stressors on lizards' behaviour. Lizards were exposed to Heat (35oC), Cold (15oC), high or low frequency noise or a Control treatment with no stimulus in a test chamber for a 5 s. The test chamber was connected to an escape chamber, accessible after exposure to the stimulus, and a small hiding chamber opposite the test chamber. Lizard behaviour was monitored during stimulus exposure and then for a further 15 minutes, after which each lizard was removed. Lizards exposed to Cold spent less time in the test chamber and more time inactive in the escape chamber. They also spent longer walking towards the hiding chamber both away from the wall and by the wall and walking in the hiding chamber away from the stimulus. Thus, cold temperatures were noxious for lizards in a simulated transport environment as they reduced activity and increased escape attempts. In a second experiment, noise exposure was studied in more detail and the behaviour of blue tongued lizards when exposed to five combinations of mining machinery noise was evaluated. Lizards were exposed to low and high frequencies (≤ or > 2 kHz) at both low (60-65 dB (A)) and high (70-75 dB (A)) amplitudes, and a Control treatment, following the same exposure technique developed in the first experiment. In the test chamber lizards exposed to any mining machinery noise, but especially high frequencies, spent more time freezing, a typical stress response in reptiles, when compared with animals in the Control treatment. In the hiding chamber, high frequencies at high amplitudes decreased durations of the head being held to the right face downwards, suggesting a lateralized fear reaction. High frequency, high amplitude noise was the most detrimental. Mining noise had negative effects on the lizards' behavior and welfare. To estimate mining machinery noise effects on the second animal model, wild mice, amplitudes and frequencies were tested separately to differentiate between these two important components of noise. Using the high and low amplitudes previously established, wild mice were exposed to 3 weeks of continuous noise. Effects of noise on their behaviour, organ morphology and fecal corticosterone levels were compared with a control treatment (no extra auditory stimuli, below 55 dB (A)). This was probably due to gender-based differences in stress activation. Circling behaviour in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions was increased in animals exposed to high amplitude noise. In mice exposed to low amplitude noise, fecal corticosterone was increased but total circling remained the same as control. These results suggest that dopamine-related stereotypies during high amplitude mining noise were a coping mechanism that prevented excessive physiological arousal. Both noise treatments increased circling to the left, which corresponds to right hemispheric activation of the stress response; however only the high amplitude noise increased circling to the right (left hemisphere activation), which may inhibit stress arousal by right hemisphere. When organ morphology was evaluated, females, housed in pairs, had responses that differed from those of males, which had to be housed individually. Females exposed to high amplitude noise had a smaller adrenal cortex and cortex/medullary ratio compared to controls. This adrenal atrophy and decreased fecal corticosterone in the high amplitude treatment indicates a state of chronic stress during noise exposure that had accentuated effects for females. Females in both the high and low noise treatments had smaller kidneys than males in these treatments, suggesting an epinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. A similar effect was seen in the males' spleens exposed to both noise treatments, expected as physiological stress can generate spleen atrophy. Females, housed in pairs, had behaviour responses that differed from those of males, which had to be housed individually. In relation to amplitude therefore, mining machinery noise produced stress response on wild mice that were amplitude dependent and appeared to require the generation of coping mechanism. As high amplitudes were the most noxious for wild mice, we used this energy intensity to evaluate the effects of mining machinery noise at two frequency ranges: high (HF > 2 kHz) and low (LF ≤ 2 kHz) on the behaviour, organ morphology and fecal corticosterone of wild mice, compared with a control treatment (no extra auditory stimuli) using the exposure methodology described for amplitude exposure. High frequency mining noise increased fecal corticosterone and decreased partial hiding and nest activity. Females were the most affected, since they had the highest fecal corticosterone levels and a tendency for spleen atrophy, probably due to a specific high frequency sensitivity. Stereotyped circling anticlockwise, but not clockwise, was increased in female mice exposed to high frequencies compared to low frequencies. Low frequency mining noise increased fecal corticosterone levels in males but not females. Thus, mining machinery noise produces stress responses in wild mice that are also frequency dependent. From both sets of experiments, it is evident that mining noise has adverse effects on the two species, both of which are found in the vicinity of mining sites. These effects are clearly frequency and amplitude dependent, which should encourage environmental policy makers to effectively regulate noise levels in mining areas.",2016,28/2/2018 6:01,15/3/2023 2:54,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Queensland,,not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,10.14264/uql.2016.188,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QMJC7QCG\s4277668_phd_thesis_final.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

BFPVZ8E2,thesis,2016,"Kay, Geoffrey Murray",Scaling the Benefits of Agri-Environment Schemes for Biodiversity Conservation in Agricultural Landscapes,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2083996177?accountid=26957,"Agricultural expansion and intensification are major causes of biodiversity loss. To mitigate this, billions of dollars are committed by governments annually to agri-environment conservation schemes aiming to engage landholders, often at large (continental) scales, in sustainable farming practices. While some schemes have been successful in addressing the social and policy elements of farmland conservation, assessments of their effectiveness for conserving biodiversity in farming systems is lacking. Recent studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness of programs is influenced by a number of scale-dependent factors that may influence biodiversity response but remain poorly understood. Specifically, local- and landscape-scale management actions can influence biodiversity response, and hence the effectiveness of programs, but this aspect has been little explored.    My research aimed to identify ways to enhance the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes through a better understanding of scale-related management effects on herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians); a critical and declining vertebrate group severely threatened by agricultural development.    First, I summarise current knowledge of local- and landscape-scale factors influencing agri-environment scheme effectiveness for biodiversity, highlighting novel research priorities relevant to practitioners (Paper #1). I then conducted baseline herpetofaunal surveys at 325 treatment/control sites within a critically endangered remnant woodland targeted under a large-scale (>1000 km; 172,000 km2) agri-environment scheme; the Australian Government Environmental Stewardship Programme (Paper #2). This is the most extensive xii herpetofaunal survey conducted to date throughout this woodland ecosystem. I found high levels of spatial variation in species detected across the study area; with large differences in species richness between biogeographic regions but not between treatment and control sites.    Second, I conducted multi-season vegetation, habitat structural and herpetofaunal surveys at each of the 325 sites to identify key habitat variables (Paper #3) and management activities (livestock grazing; Paper #4) at local levels. I found that habitat use varied over biogeographically distinct regions, suggesting schemes that consider regional differences in local habitat preferences may be more effective than schemes that ignore such variation. Furthermore, past and present livestock grazing influenced herpetofaunal populations, but in complex and varied ways that have previously been overlooked.    Finally, I collected data on land-use surrounding the remnant woodland sites and its influence on reptile movement to quantify the impact of landscape modification on community structure (Paper #5) and habitat connectivity (Paper #6). Landscape modification resulted in a change in community composition and a loss of species co-occurrence, but not a loss of species. Importantly, changes in co-occurrence pattern were complex and allowed for a novel classification of species susceptibility to the threat of land modification. Additionally, I found that pasture height and crop-sowing direction influenced reptile movements within the agricultural matrix, and hence must be considered where connectivity is a goal of agri-environment investment (Paper #6). Collectively, my research identifies several outcomes that strengthen the theoretical and applied opportunities for enhancing effectiveness of agri-environment schemes. These include: (1) An improved knowledge of the environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the distributions of herpetofauna (2) Incorporating ecological effects operating at different scales can help agri-environment schemes to become more effective (3) A range of management actions is required to meet the conservation requirements for herpetofauna (4) Large occupancy datasets should be collected to extend observations of ecological patterns to identify underlying ecological processes (5) Management recommendations can be adaptively integrated into existing agri-environment schemes; as well as in new schemes. Such considerations are of broad relevance for the design of large-scale conservation strategies targeting the conservation of biodiversity across agricultural landscapes.",2016,21/1/2020 3:22,6/1/2021 6:21,,,378,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,2083996177,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3BP9V3JX\Kay - 2016 - Scaling the Benefits of Agri-Environment Schemes f.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

A series of comparative studies into the reproductive biology and regeneration niche are reported for M. deanei and three common Melaleuca species from the area: Melaleuca nodosa (Sol. ex Gaertn.) Sm., Melaleuca styphelioides Sm and Melaleuca thymifolia Sm. Measures of population structure were first quantified for each species and for replicate large and small populations of M. deanei; these include plant density, abundance and size class distributions, canopy seed loads and seed viability. The timing, frequency and synchrony of flowering of each species over three seasons were also documented. Smaller populations of M. deanei were found to contain lower quantities of viable seed per square metre, lower proportions of fruiting plants and to flower less frequently in comparison to plants from the larger populations of M. deanei or those of the common congeners. Flowering, when it occurred in M. deanei, was later than the common congeners, from mid-late October through to late November-early December. Increased flowering of M. deanei was documented along road edges and in years following fire. The work also confirmed significantly lower proportions of seedlings in all populations of M. deanei and M. styphelioides. Seedling recruitment in both species is rare and would appear to require specific conditions. These population level studies suggest that rarity in M. deanei is related to low recruitment success, infrequent flowering and low seed loads.",2016,28/2/2018 6:04,6/1/2021 6:20,,,289,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Western Sydney University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1943294143,ProQuest,ProQuest,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\TW7B8KU4\Hewitt - 2016 - Reproductive biology of one rare and three common .pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Each approach maintains the assumption that the information about the objects represented in the Information System (IS) is specified and verified by domain experts and potential users. Yet, as more IS are developed to support a larger diversity of users such as customers, suppliers, and members of the general public (such as many multi-user online systems), analysts can no longer rely on a stable single group of people for complete specification of domains-to the extent that prior research has questioned the efficacy of conceptual modeling in these heterogeneous settings. We formulated principles for identifying basic classes in a domain. These classes can guide conceptual modeling, database design, and user interface development in a wide variety of traditional and emergent domains. Moreover, we used a case study of a large foster organization to study how unstructured data entry practices result in differences in how information is collected across organizational units. We used institutional theory to show how institutional elements enacted by individuals can generate new practices that can be adopted over time as best practices. We analyzed free-text notes to prioritize potential cases of psychotropic drug use-our tactical need. We showed that too much flexibility in how data can be entered into the system, results in different styles, which tend to be homogenous across organizational units but not across organizational units.

G2QSQM2L,thesis,2016,"Buru, J. C.","Comparative biology of two forms of an invasive vine, Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) Lohmann (Bignoniaceae): implications for weed spread and biocontrol",,,,,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/102084/,"Cat's claw creeper, Dolichandra unguis-cati (Bignoniaceae) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS) in Australia and a major environmental weed in Queensland and New South Wales states. Two forms of this weed ('short pod' and 'long pod') occur in Australia. Short pod is widely distributed in Australia, but long pod is only found in a few localities in southeast Queensland. There is a general lack of understanding why the two forms are not equally prevalent. Previous studies have shown significant differences in the flowering phenology and leaf morphology of the two forms. Despite these differences, the same biological control agents are used in the management strategies for the two forms. Preference tests have not been performed to determine whether biological control agents would choose one form over the other. The aims of this study were twofold, firstly, to use a trait-based framework to compare germination, anatomical and physiological traits between long pod and short pod. This aim included an assessment of trait responses to different water, light and nutrient resource conditions. Secondly, the study sought to test the preference of two biological control agents, Carvalhotingis visenda and Hylaeogena jureceki for the two forms under different water and nutrient resource conditions. The study found short pod to have significantly higher germination rates and higher levels of polyembryony than long pod. Short pod also exhibited significantly higher germination plasticity than long pod. Short pod foliar anatomy indicated presence of thicker leaves and significantly higher frequency of foliar nectaries than long pod. Short pod had a less compact spongy mesophyll with larger intercellular spaces than long pod. Only one type of epidermal hair (unicellular trichomes) was observed in short pod. Conversely, long pod had two types of epidermal hairs (unicellular and multicellular trichomes). The distribution of unicellular trichomes was higher in long pod than in short pod. Short pod performed better than long pod, as indicated by production of higher biomass and more tubers and branches under low nutrient resources. Short pod exhibited higher values of carbon assimilation, water use efficiency and leaf nitrogen than long pod in response to water, light and nutrient resources. However, long pod produced more biomass than short pod under high light and nutrient resource conditions. Phenotypic integration did not differ between long pod and short pod when considering all resource levels. However, short pod exhibited significantly higher phenotypic integration when high light and nutrients were considered separately. Short pod developed a significantly higher number of tubers than long pod in response to water, light and nutrient resources. Overall short pod performed better than long pod in response to different resource conditions. A multivariate exploration of functional traits using principal components analysis showed a clear separation of the two forms along the second axis. The second axis was influenced by shoot/root ratio, tuber development, WUE, leaf nitrogen and quantum yield of photosystem II. Biological control preference results show that C. visenda does not have a preference for any form while H. jureceki have a preference for long pod over short pod. Resource level had a significant effect on preference for both forms, with agents choosing the high nutrient plants the most. Results from this study make a significant contribution to our understanding of why short pod is the prevalent form in Australia. Short pod was shown to exhibit more traits that are associated with fast growing invaders. Higher rates of germination and polyembryony could have contributed to the spread of short pod. Higher values for relative growth rates, tuber biomass and branching shown by short pod are traits that enhance colonization success. Moreover, short pod exhibited higher phenotypic integration and greater germination plasticity in response to different levels of resources than long pod, indicating greater capacity to invade environmentally heterogenous habitats. Although long pod did not perform as well as short pod for most traits, accumulation of higher biomass under high light and nutrient conditions imply potential for colonization success by this form under disturbance scenarios. Lack of preference for either form by C. visenda implies that this agent is suitable for continual use against long pod and short pod. On the contrary, preference for long pod by H. jureceki implies a potential lack of efficacy of this agent on the more prevalent short pod form. A preference pattern by agents in the field could jeopardize biological control efforts for D. unguiscati in Australia. More research needs to be carried out in the field to substantiate findings from this study. An evaluation of biological control method against D. unguis-cati is suggested, especially in light of occurrence of long pod and short pod. The striking differences in life history traits between long pod and short pod in this study inevitably raise questions about the taxonomy of the two forms. Differences in germination traits and frequency of polyembryony, growth patterns, tuber development and response to environmental conditions have taxonomic implications for the two forms. Differences in leaf anatomical traits such as types of hairs and nectaries have taxonomic implications for the two forms, and have previously been used in taxonomic resolution in Bignoniaceae. Thus, the outcomes of this study corroborate a previous hypothesis that these two forms may be different species. A phylogenetic analysis of the genus Dolichandra with extensive sampling of all possible forms of D. unguis-cati from both the native and introduced range is recommended. To test the biological species concept, we recommend studies that will test whether the two forms of D. unguis-cati can interbreed. As there were significantly higher germination rates and greater polyembryony in the short pod than long pod, flower or seed-eating biological control agents would be appropriate in the management of the short pod.",2016,28/2/2018 6:02,15/3/2023 3:01,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,QUT,,not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\N6FSKNSC\Joshua Comrade_Buru_Thesis.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

The Battler project area is approximately 14km south-south east of Southern Cross, Western Australia (WA). The purpose of this Level 1 fauna risk assessment was to provide information to the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) on the potential impact to the vertebrate fauna assemblage in the project area from clearing the vegetation and developing a mine. The assessed area that was approximately 148ha. The existing disturbance area is 8.5ha. It is proposed that an additional 27.6ha is disturbed, made up of 5ha for the pit, 17.7ha for the waste dump, 13.4ha for infrastructure making a total footprint of 36.1ha. The project area is mostly flat or gently undulating and vegetated with tall open Eucalypt woodland over an understorey of shrubs. The height and density of scattered shrubs varied. Some sections contained a ground cover of leaf litter, in other sections, the ground was mostly bare. The central area that had been previously mined contained almost no vegetation. This area contained a mining pit, waste dumps, access tracks and evidence of recent exploration activity. There are multiple tracks through the project area and evidence that the area is regularly used by trail bikes. A couple of sections have been used for the dumping of rubbish. Clearing native vegetation is likely to result in the loss of small vertebrate fauna that are unable to move away during the clearing process. The few larger animals, such as kangaroos, and most of the birds will move into adjacent areas once clearing commences. Shifting animals into adjacent areas will increase the pressure on resources in those areas and it is likely that there will be some disruption to the ecosystems in these areas for a period of time until a balance is restored. There is a possibility that the threatened Western Rosella (Platycercus icterotis xanthogenys) and Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) may infrequently be found in the vicinity of the project area. These birds will move to adjacent areas once vegetation clearing commences. There is a very low possibility that the project area supports a very low number of Chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), but this could only be confirmed by a trapping program, but that is not considered necessary. Given the size of the proposed disturbance, any Chuditch in the area will move to adjacent habitat and are unlikely to be impacted by the development, other than having a reduced area in which to forage. Results from this assessment indicate that the risks of significantly impacting on native fauna, fauna assemblages and important fauna habitat are low when placed in a regional context, and if the recommended management strategies are implemented, then the risks will be further reduced. Clearing of an additional 27.6ha of vegetation is unlikely to significantly impact on any listed species of conservation significance.",2016,28/2/2018 5:36,23/3/2023 22:34,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Terrestrial Ecosystems,"Mt Claremont, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\ARB7V4WI\Terrestrial Ecosystems - 2016 - Level 1 Fauna Risk Assessment for the Battler Proj.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Phragmites is the subject of many research projects, and is a useful model to better understand when and how a species becomes invasive, because of its ability to establish, survive, expand and modify the environment within which it persists (Meyerson et al. 2016). The native range of Phragmites occurs in eastern and central Australia from Cape York to Tasmania (Atlas of Living Australia 2016). Phragmites has undergone a redistribution on account of anthropogenic influences (Roberts 2000a), with contraction tending to be more common in northern Australia compared with expansion in South Australia (Packer unpublished data). One of the expanding populations that are of particular conservation concern is within the Fleurieu Peninsula Swamps (hereafter referred to as Fleurieu Swamps) in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia. These wetlands are recognised and protected as an endangered ecological community under the Commonwealths Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The locally named Black Swamp is a Fleurieu Swamp ecological community that occurs within the lower Tookayerta and lower Finniss catchments. This entire Black Swamp is within the boundary of the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLMM) region. Landholders and the Fleurieu Swamp Recovery Team have observed a significant and ongoing expansion of Phragmites since 2003. This expansion corresponds with a time when conservationists were urging landholders to remove the grazing pressure from their swamps. Grazing is known to limit reed height and density while stock are present ((Bart and Hartman 2000; Haslam 1972; Spence 1964; Vulink et al. 2000), and to increase these when the grazing pressure is removed (Ranwell 1961). In the Fleurireu Swamps, historic grazing and its recent removal appears to have resulted in the expansion of Phragmites monospecific stands. This project was designed to address the Phragmites expansion within the Black Swamp and lower Tookayerta system by identifying the environmental, biological and anthropogenic drivers that influenced Phragmites establishment and persistence. Findings from this project demonstrate that Phragmites has indeed expanded within the Black Swamp system, particularly in areas where grazing has been removed. The research project concluded that the monospecific stands of Phragmites were correlated with reduced floristic richness in the study system, and that other parts of the Tookayerta are also vulnerable to Phragmites expansion and dominance. The dense and tall Phragmites populations occurred on sites with lower water table and deeper litter accumulation compared with mixed vegetation communities. In contrast, the wetter areas of this swamp system tended to support shorter Phragmites and the vegetation community was more floristically diverse. This study also suggested that cutting and flooding can negatively impact Phragmites and can be considered a management tool if the seasonal and environmental conditions are suitable. The findings from this study provide critical restoration considerations for the Black Swamp region and surrounding landscape. Revegetation with tube stock planting is unlikely to be successful if it occurs in proximity (e.g. <50 m) to existing robust Phragmites stands. Phragmites has the potential to reduce water and nutrient availability beyond the aboveground edge of the stand and to crowd out revegetated areas as stem density increases. The expansion of Phragmites also has biodiversity conservation implications for threatened species, such as the endangered Mount Lofty Ranges Southern Emu-wren, that require structurally complex habitats.",2016,28/2/2018 5:36,23/3/2023 23:13,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Conservation Council of SA and The University of Adelaide,"South Australia, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\98ISTCWT\Duffield and Roberts - 2016 - Monitoring of Phragmites australis expansion and r.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

PBD is a fundamental concept of biodiversity informatics since it is substantial in quantity and provides the links to organize other large and independent bodies of data concerning species (= taxonomic information) and environments. In fact, PBD is at the core of the exploding field of biodiversity informatics, which in some sense now underlies biogeography, macroecology, landscape ecology and several other subdisciplines of biology. A principal - and rapidly growing - class of research that can be performed using PBD is the estimation of a species' environmental requirements and the projection of these in both environmental and geographic spaces to estimate niches or distributional ranges, generally by using models of ecological niches and species' distributions (often called ENMs or SDMs, respectively). The largest point of access to PBD in the world is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and hundreds of papers have now used GBIF-mediated data to fit and apply ENM/SDM. Experience has shown that GBIF, like other aggregated data research infrastructures, holds a number of potential problems related to incomplete or difficult access to all the fields in its schema, inconsistent information among fields, or simply erroneous or incomplete data. These drawbacks complicate ENM/SDM analyses considerably, and detract from the enormous scientific value of this information storehouse. Three overlapping communities participate in GBIF's data process: providers (museums, herbaria, and observer's networks), users (scientists, analysts working for governments, NGOs or the private sector, the public) and the technical staff managing the huge databases, web services and servers at GBIF. Each can play a different role in fixing data issues of GBIF. Our main recommendations for the GBIF Secretariat are the following:  GBIF.org should serve indicators of precision, quality, and uncertainty of data that can be calculated practically, and preferably ""on the fly"", as well as summaries and metrics of completeness of inventories, at scales and for regions defined by the user. The summaries should display maps and graphs of completeness by region, time-period and taxa.  The implementation of the GBIF information resource should go beyond unique identifiers of queries (DOIs for downloads, including the capability to re-run queries, http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/summary#supporteddatasettypes), and to include identifiers of the individual data that make up the queried data.  GBIF.org should include applications or functionalities enabling users to annotate errors or problems, and communicate those changes directly to providers, as it may be practical and appropriate. This point may need to be discussed with providers.  A procedure enabling users to make accessible versions of their databases that have been improved and annotated should be supported, but this functionality should not lose the vital tie back to the original data records and the actual data provider.  GBIF should partner with and/or support initiatives to do more for training and guiding users on the proper use of the data; such initiatives should incorporate actual expert uses in ENM/SDM to assure that current best practices are followed.",2016,28/2/2018 6:09,15/3/2023 3:13,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,GBIF,,not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.27191.93608,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\Z6S7MU9V\Anderson et al. - 2016 - Final report of the task group on GBIF data fitnes.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Chlorotic lesions can subsequently become anthocyanic (associated with reddening), then necrotic and eventually affected leaves are abscised prematurely. Since Cardiaspina nymphs can accelerate leaf abscission, they are key contributors to eucalypt dieback. The synthesis of anthocyanins within feeding lesions could be explained as a response of leaves to photodamage while the synthesis of phenolic compounds (and even leaf abscission) could be considered an induced defence against the nymphs.

The platform allows the evaluation of up to 120 plants growing in individual pots. A cart moving in only one direction carries the measuring and watering devices. Watering and measurement routines allow the simulation of multiple water regimes for each plant individually and indicate the timing of measurement of soil water content and image capture for growth estimation. Water use, growth and water use efficiency were measured in two experiments with different water scenarios.

The time scale encompasses the rise and collapse of the earliest agrarian civilizations in this region. The archaeological record suggests that increases in social complexity were linked to climatic episodes (e.g., favorable climatic conditions coincide with intervals of prosperity or marked social development such as the Neolithic Revolution ca. 11.5 ka BP, the Secondary Products Revolution ca. 6 ka BP, and the Middle Bronze Age ca. 4 ka BP). The opposite can be said about periods of climatic deterioration, when settled villages were abandoned as the inhabitants returned to nomadic or semi nomadic lifestyles (e.g., abandonment of the largest Neolithic farming towns after 8 ka BP and collapse of Bronze Age towns and cities after 3.5 ka BP during the Late Bronze Age).   This study develops chronologically refined models of past vegetation from 12 to 2.5 ka BP, at 500 year intervals, using GIS, remote sensing and statistical modeling tools (MAXENT) that derive from species distribution modeling. Plants are sensitive to alterations in their environment and respond accordingly. Because of this, they are valuable indicators of landscape change. An extensive database of historical and field gathered observations was created. Using this database as well as environmental variables that include temperature and precipitation surfaces for the whole study period (also at 500 year intervals), the potential vegetation of the region was modeled. Through this means, a continuous chronology of potential vegetation of the Southern Levantwas built.    The produced paleo-vegetation models generally agree with the proxy records. They indicate a gradual decline of forests and expansion of steppe and desert throughout the Holocene, interrupted briefly during the Mid Holocene (ca. 4 ka BP, Middle Bronze Age). They also suggest that during the Early Holocene, forest areas were extensive, spreading into the Northern Negev. The two remaining forested areas in the Northern and Southern Plateau Region in Jordan were also connected during this time. The models also show general agreement with the major cultural developments, with forested areas either expanding or remaining stable during prosperous periods (e.g., Pre Pottery Neolithic and Middle Bronze Age), and significantly contracting during moments of instability (e.g., Late Bronze Age).",2011,21/1/2020 3:22,14/1/2021 9:41,,,403,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Arizona State University,Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,884594412,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MTANQNL3\Soto-Berelov - 2011 - Vegetation Modeling of Holocene Landscapes in the .pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Building upon previous work based on field surveys and morphological characters, I am here focusing on elucidating the phylogenetic placement of mangrove-bound species from three different bird families as well as the comparative phylogeographic analysis of eight co-distributed mangrove restricted birds.    In the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of fantails (Aves: Rhipiduride) I document six distinct clades, harboring members spread across large geographic extents. Rhipidura hypoxantha is not a true fantail, but rather a member of the Stenostiridae clade that is morphologically and behaviorally convergent with fantails. The Australian mangrove fantails R. phasiana  and R. dryas both evolved recently from Pacific island radiations.    A molecular phylogeny of all extant species of the honeyeater genus  Lichenostomus (Aves: Meliphagidae) also addresses the relationship of the only mangrove-restricted honeyeaters on Australia's east coast,  L. versicolor and L. fasciogularis. These species were not sisters but rather L. versicolor was sister to the pair comprising L. fasciogularis and the continental widespread Singing Honeyeater L. virescens. The genus Lichenostomus  is not monophyletic, and instead comprises seven distinct lineages interdispersed within the larger meliphagid assemblage. Based on this taxonomic and nomenclatural revision, recognition of a novel genus of honeyeater is warranted.    A multilocus molecular phylogeny of gerygones (Aves; Acanthizidae) establishes that the three mangrove endemic species do not form a monophyletic clade, instead indicating three distinct, temporally non-overlapping, radiations into magroves. Moreover, G. cinerea from New Guinea is in fact a member of the genus Acanthiza, with which it consistently grouped based on 13 distinct molecular loci analyzed.    Comparative phylogeographic analyses of 8 co-distributed mangrove forest endemic birds concludes biogeographic barriers such as the Canning Gap, Bonaparte Gap, and the Carpentarian Gaps all had important, but varying degrees of impact on the species we analyzed. Species with more recent radiations into mangroves include Rhipidura phasiana, Myiagra ruficollis, and  Myzomela erythrocephala, while Peneoenanthe pulverulenta, Pachycephala melanura, P. lanioides, Zosterops luteus, and  Colluricincla megarhyncha all had more marked phylogeographic signatures.",2011,28/2/2018 6:06,14/1/2021 9:40,,,153,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Kansas,Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,872552967,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\JIR9CJ9K\Nyari - 2011 - Origin and evolution of the unique Australo-Papuan.pdf,,4 - ALA acknowledged

In short, it has sought to mainstream innovation in and through the creative industries for policy consideration, deepen it for academic engagement, and apply it for industry and community benefit. The 'object of study' has been arguably more changeable over the period than fields of research intensity such as biotechnology, medical research or IT. Rapid developments, in particular in social media, have occasioned major social, economic and cultural impact. Significant theoretical work has been developed around economics and culture which attempts to feed into this volatile landscape. There is much further to be done.

State administration has also used the system to support new laws and regulations. Now it is time to rethink the system, which has grown in an ad-hoc, unstructured way, aiming at the support that will be needed for the next 10 years. In a project jointly funded by Microsoft Research and FAPESP, we aim at the creation of a specification for the new Sin Biota 2.0 system, including cutting-edge services and technologies on information technology, in order to achieve a number of goals, namely: guarantee the use and expansion of the system for the next ten years, support the availability of a larger volume of higher quality environmental data, oriented also to the educational and public administration sectors, provide more efficient sharing of data among BIOTA researchers, inter-operate with international initiatives, provide effective tools to assist researchers in finding relevant information amongst a large amount of environment data. The expected results at the end of this project are the composition of a specification (Reference Document) of the Sin Biota 2.0 system, and the implementation of a prototype that will gradually replace the current system. We propose in this work the system architecture and our vision of the main features that would allow Sin Biota 2.0 to meet the expectations of the biodiversity research community and other stakeholders. We also describe a prototype application that implements most of the features present in the current Sin Biota 1.0 system, as well as some of the new features envisaged for the new version.

Today, however, this knowledge, along with the primary data associated with a given object (specimen) may be digitized and stored in databases, presented on the Web, aggregated by other resources, disseminated in paper and/or digital publications, and be stored and displayed in many diverse settings. This reality presents the biodiversity community with both an opportunity and a challenge in attempting to maintain the knowledge learned about collection objects, which traditionally has been tightly contained in collections but now may be widely distributed across independent resources. This knowledge can also be extended beyond identification-based annotation to assertions about any datum, record, or set that has a relationship to a collection object, its physical derivatives (e.g. ., botanical duplicates; mammal skins, bones, tissues, etc.; genetic samples), or associated objects (e.g., field images; audio recordings; host or pollination vectors), as well as to unvouchered observations of organisms. The opportunity that computer-based annotation services and networks present is to both maximize knowledge gain about organisms and efficiently disseminate it to everyone who has a vested interest in it. Yet corresponding challenges exist in discovering, managing, and sharing the annotations across disparate resources with widely varying infrastructure. Several projects have incorporated annotations as a core component for communication within and between resources. A few examples include the Atlas of Living Australia, Biodiversity Heritage Library, BiSciColl, Filtered Push, Morphbank, and VertNet.

KVIU8RG4,conferencePaper,2011,"Elseley, M.; Cartwright, W.","Issues related to the use of non-traditional, digital data sources for enhancing park management data",Proceedings of the Surveying & Spatial Sciences Biennial Conference 2011,,,,,"The Web provides access to digital archives containing information made available by news organisations, governments, libraries and the like. In the New Web era, data providers now also include the general public who can contribute information using collaborative and participatory tools, available via the Web or mobile devices and collectively known as Web 2.0. With the arrival of geospatial platforms, mapping tools and devices that are location aware, a growing amount of these data is geo-referenced. A research project is investigating if the existing data archive of a park management organisation can be enhanced through amalgamation with these digital data repositories available via the Web - alternative data sources that traditionally have not always been considered. The project is developing a methodology for a 'geo-knowledge tool' to access data based in part on their geographic attributes. The methodology comprises a conceptual model and demonstration prototype. This paper addresses two issues associated with the data and theoretical methodologies devised to address these. The first issue addressed concerns the variation in the georeferencing of data including different methods like coordinates and geotagging, and a variation in geographic detail or precision. A basic geographic framework is described comprising a fixed, formal component and a dynamic part that combined recognise official, conventional and personal georeferences thus allowing for the broadest possible range of relevant data to be presented. A second issue identified relates to the 'accuracy' and 'usefulness' of alternative data. It is argued that setting clear guidelines for these two terms is not straightforward, and their importance may vary depending on the purpose and opinion of the user of the data. A methodology is proposed that uses a number of data attributes to derive confidence ratings. These can be attached to the data to assist users in assessing whether the data will be suitable for their purpose. To address the complexity of deriving a single rating, one solution would be to make the system a user driven rating alongside a 'formal' rating guide. The second solution proposes to create confidence ratings for individual data attributes with users to decide which attributes rank higher for their purpose. In both cases it is envisaged that the confidence ratings model should become an evolving model with users attaching ratings as the data are being used.",2011,18/4/2018 2:23,14/1/2021 5:44,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Wellington, NZ",not specified,,,,,GS 2012,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3CD3YVPR\Elseley and Cartwright - 2011 - Issues related to the use of non-traditional, digi.pdf",,5 - ALA mentioned

These studies are based on assessment and monitoring of biodiversity that occur by means of the collection, storage, analysis, simulation, modeling, visualization and sharing of a significant volume of biodiversity data in broad temporal and spatial scale. Species occurrences data are a particularly important type of biodiversity data because they are widely used in various studies. Nevertheless, for the analyzing and modeling obtained from these data to be reliable, the data used must be high quality. Thus, to improve the Data Quality (DQ) of species occurrences, the aim of this work was to conduct a study about DQ applied to species occurrences data that allowed assessing and improving the DQ using techniques and resources to prevent errors. This study was applied to an Information System (IS) designed to digitize species occurrences, the Biodiversity Data Digitizer (BDD), that was developed in the scope of the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network Pollinators Thematic Network (IABIN-PTN) and BioAbelha FAPESP projects. A literature review about species occurrences data and about the most relevant data domains was conducted. For the most important data domains identified (taxon, geospatial and location), a study on the DQ Assessment was performed, in which important DQ dimensions (aspects) and problems that affect theses dimensions were identified, defined and interrelated. Based upon this study, computational resources were identified that would allow improving the DQ by reducing errors. Using the errors preventing DQ Management approach, 13 computing resources to support the prevention of 8 DQ problems were identified, thus providing an improvement of accuracy, precision, completeness, consistency, credibility of source and believability of taxonomic, geospatial and location data of species occurrences. These resources were implemented in two tools integrated to the BDD IS. The first tool is the BDD Taxon Tool. This tool facilitates the entrance of error-free taxonomic data of occurrences by means of fuzzy matching techniques and suggestions for taxonomic names and hierarchies based on Catalog of Life, among other resources. The second tool, the BDD Geo Tool, helps to fill in error-free geospatial and location data about species occurrence by means of georeferencing techniques from natural language description of location, reverse georeferencing and Google Earth interactive maps, among other resources. This work showed that with the development of certain computing resources integrated to an IS, DQ problems are reduced by preventing errors. As a result of reducing some problems in particular, the DQ in specific data domains is improved for certain DQ dimensions.",2012,28/2/2018 5:37,13/1/2021 7:07,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Escola Politécnica, Brazil",,not specified,,Masters,,,GS 2012,,10.11606/D.3.2012.tde-03052012-120914,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\J6CZU3KB\Dissertacao_Allan_Koch_Veiga.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Often, human activities are responsible for biological invasions that alter significantly the various ecosystems and could lead to the extinction of native species. Dendrocephalus brasiliensis ( branconeta ) is a native freshwater Anostraca species, which has been studied and used in aquaculture to replace the brine shrimp originating from saline environments. Its occurrence in natural environments was recorded in Brazilian southeast and northeast regions, from the city of Urucuia-MG to Piaui State. However, there are records of its accidental introduction into fish ponds in Sao Paulo state, cities of Tabatinga and Arealva. The goal of this work is the study of the interactions of competition and predation / herbivory between D. brasiliensis and other planktonic species native of Sao Paulo in order to assess the possible impacts of a possible introduction of this species in natural environments where it does not occur originally. This study was conducted in an experimental system (10.000L tank) in Aquaculture Station of Department of Hydrobiology (EA-DHb), Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar), Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil. Initially, the experimental tank was inoculated with the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata grown in laboratory. After the establishment of phytoplankton, zooplankton species were collected in limnic ecosystems of Sao Paulo state, in particular near Sao Carlos (June and July/2011), for the establishment of a zooplankton community in the experimental tank. Zooplankton succession in the tank was monitored for 133days before the introduction of branconeta. To evaluate the interaction of D. brasiliensis with other zooplankton species, the experimental tank was divided in two equal compartments that do not communicate to each other: one of them was kept with the original composition of the zooplankton, while in the other, cysts of the anostracean were introduced. In both experimental compartments samples were collected daily during 39 days, for quantitative and qualitative analyzes of zooplankton community, besides chlorophyll a, physical and chemical variables. The environmental variables were correlated to zooplankton groups using the statistical method of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Numerical densities of Cladocera and Copepoda groups decreased in the presence of D. brasiliensis. We can conclude that the presence of D. brasiliensis does not exclude but significantly alters the composition and density of the plankton community.",2012,28/2/2018 6:09,13/1/2021 7:05,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Universidad Federal de Sao Carlos, Brazil",,not specified,,Masters,,,GS 2012,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\4JTUW3BH\Paccagnella - 2012 - Estudo da dinâmica populacional e interações bioló.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

GDI7Y3J9,thesis,2012,"Hill, Andrew William",Building data into knowledge: Identifying challenges and their solutions in biodiversity informatics,,,,,https://scholar.colorado.edu/ebio_gradetds/37/,"Biologists are in a race to document biodiversity in the face of ailing ecosystems and species decline. The drive to create knowledge to support effective documentation, measurement, and conservation of biodiversity has led the community to quickly research and develop methods to organize and connect biodiversity data across providers and throughout the world. Biodiversity data came online through distributed and disconnected databases but through time has been shaped into a biodiversity network that now represents nearly 500 million biodiversity records. The ability to access these data has brought exciting new research and new challenges. In this thesis I discuss my work to solve some of those challenges and build innovative approaches and tools for biodiversity informatics. I start by documenting tools that help improve the quality and fitness for use of data. Then I present two tools for visualizing and analyzing data in a phylogenetic and conservation context. More importantly, I discuss how designing these tools to operate within a greater knowledge creation framework can make the work of documenting patterns and processes in biodiversity faster and more resilient to future changes and improved information. At the heart of that discussion is the idea that the outputs of the tools themselves should be published and directly linked back to the original data and forward to any future analyses. The outputs should also document all models, parameters, and heuristics used do arrive at the reported outcome. In this way, both the data and our research of that data can be woven into a connected fabric of knowledge and information that links biodiversity and the digital data stored in our databases. Finally, I discuss the possibility we have for expanding our biodiversity data and improving the research we can do with it through the use of citizen science.  The data available today is still deficient. Natural history collections hold a wealth of data that has not yet been digitized, but as a community we lack the resources to unlock that data quickly without a novel solution. Citizen science offers us the ability to quickly generate historical biodiversity data from natural history collections. We present a novel platform for engaging citizen scientists and developing a shared, community driven, platform to harness the potential of citizen science.",2012,28/2/2018 6:04,13/1/2021 7:03,,,183,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Colorado at Boulder,Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1283387699,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\M5I98LLM\Hill - 2012 - Building data into knowledge Identifying challeng.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Under climate change, current hydrological systems are exposed to potential changes in climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall. However, what these changes may look like, such as their impacts on flow, water quality and aquatic biota, are still largely unknown. The objectives of WRMP involve identifying where metrics quantifying characteristics of hydrological regimes, so called 'hydrometrics', can provide guidance on how such impacts can be analysed or quantified and where such metrics can to be integrated into a broader framework that includes ecological and social dimensions. Specifically, the project has compiled a summary of catchment yields and runoff characteristics for historic, current and future climates for a range of regions within Australia and conducted workshops aimed at improving understanding of what information is perceived to be important to stakeholders in the water sector as well as identifying new roles for hydrological models in this context.",2012,28/2/2018 5:36,23/3/2023 4:02,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, Australia",Australia,not specified,,,,,GS 2012,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\Z94YZ35I\Casaril et al. - 2012 - Hydro-climate Knowledge Needs for Climate Change A.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

DVGZC82L,thesis,2013,"Naz, T.",Chemical and biological studies of medicinal plants used by the Yaegl Aboriginal community of Australia,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/337798,"This PhD study was based on the ethnomedicinal knowledge of the Yaegl Aboriginal community of northern NSW, Australia. It follows previous investigations of the Indigenous Bioresources Research Group (IBRG) on first-hand documentation of and preliminary screening of some medicinal plants used by the Yaegl community for treatment of wounds, sores and skin infections. The overall aim of this project was to isolate and indentify bioactive components from two medicinal plants of the Yaegl community. Two Indigenous Australian medicinal plants, Lophostemon suaveolens and Alphitonia excelsa were selected for detailed chemical and biological studies. This selection was on the basis of a literature review on the Yaegl medicinal plants documented by the IBRG for the treatment of wounds, sores and skin infections, preliminary screening results of previous IBRG researchers, and specific Yaegl community requests. Antimicrobial activity (disc diffusion, MTT microdilution and TLC bioautography assays), anti-inflammatory activity (NO, TNF-α, PGE2 and COX inhibitory assays) and antioxidant activity (ORAC assay) of these two plants were evaluated. Leaves of L. suaveolens were extracted sequentially with n-hexane, DCM, EtOAc and MeOH. Significant antimicrobial activity was observed with the n-hexane and DCM extracts with IC90 <50 μg/mL against antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MDRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes in the MTT microdilution assay. Both extracts also showed significant NO inhibitory activity in RAW264 cells with IC50 43.9 μg/mL and 4.6 μg/mL, respectively, for the n-hexane and DCM extracts. These extracts (n-hexane and DCM) did not show TNF-α or PGE2 inhibitory activity. GC-MS analysis of the oily n-hexane extract identified 16 components including the well known bioactive compounds aromadendrene (15.47%), spathulenol (12.46%), globulol (4.47%), epiglobulol (2.69%), phytol (2.84%), βcaryophyllene (2.53%) and α-humulene (1.52%). These compounds were reported for having antimicrobial (aromadendrene, spathulenol, globulol, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and phytol), anti-inflammatory (β-caryophyllene) and cytotoxic (β-caryophyllene, spathulenol and α-humulene) properties. Further fractionation of the DCM extract by normal plase silica gel column chromatography yielded five major bioactive fractions that showed good antimicrobial (IC90 <50-1000 μg/mL range against Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus. aureus), NO inhibitory (IC50 <12 μg/mL), PGE2 inhibitory (<20 μg/mL) and modest antioxidant (1000-2700 μM TE/g) activities. Further bioassay guided studies on these active fractions using different chromatographic procedures led to the isolation of betulinic acid and eucalyptin from the n-hexane and DCM extracts. Eucalyptin has been previously reported to have antimicrobial properties and betulinic acid is a well known anti-inflammatory compound. This is the first report of bioassay studies and isolation of bioactive compounds from L. suaveolens. Leaves of A. excelsa were extracted sequentially with n-hexane, DCM, EtOAc and MeOH. They were also extracted with water to mimic some preparation practices of the Yaegl community. The EtOAc extract showed promising antimicrobial activity (IC90 <50 μg/mL against S. pyogenes and IC90 500-1000 μg/mL against antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains of S. aureus) in the MTT microdilution assay. The EtOAc extract also showed potent nitric oxide (NO) inhibition (IC50 10.7 μg/mL) and promising antioxidant (3.70*103 μM TE/g) activities. The MeOH extract of A. excelsa displayed moderate levels of antimicrobial (IC90 1000 and 62.5 μg/mL against S. aureus and S. pyogenes, respectively, in MTT microdilution assay) and anti-inflammatory (IC50 30.5 μg/mL in NO inhibition assay) activities. The water extract showed good anti-inflammatory activity in the COX inhibitory assay and modest antioxidant activity in the ORAC assay. Further bioassay guided isolation of the EtOAc extract led to the isolation of two bioactive flavonoids, kaempferol and quercetin. Both isolated compounds showed antimicrobial activity (IC90 ≤62.5 μg/mL against S. pyogenes, sensitive and resistant strains of S. aureus) in the MTT microdilution assay. This is the first report of isolation of these two compounds from A. excelsa. Nurturing and sustaining a strong relationship with the Yaegl Indigenous people and providing capacity strengthening opportunities for the community was an essential part of this research. This is aligned with the best ethical practices essential for working with Indigenous people on their knowledge systems.

D. M.; Parr, C.; Willoughby, S.",Global biodiversity informatics outlook: delivering biodiversity knowledge in the information age,,,,,http://orca.cf.ac.uk/71243/,"In order to preserve the variety of life on Earth, we must understand it better. The world's governments missed their target to reduce significantly the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. One of the main reasons for this was the shortage of available information. To create appropriate policies to protect habitats we must understand what they contain, how the species within them interact, and how they might respond to changes and pressures, natural and manmade. With the adoption of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-20, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, governments have re-affirmed the importance of preserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining the planet's ecosystem services. Biodiversity informatics does not merely contribute towards meeting these goals: it is fundamental to achieving them. The last 250 years of biodiversity research have produced a wealth of information, but too much of it is still locked away and inaccessible. At the same time, new technologies and scientific approaches are today unleashing a flood of new data that could help us towards this fundamental understanding, but only if we are able to harness it effectively. Mobilizing all biodiversity data, old and new, in a structured and standardized form would enable a vast range of uses, creating new opportunities for research and putting biodiversity-related policy making on a sounder footing. Much progress has been made in the past ten years to fulfil the potential of biodiversity informatics. However, it is dwarfed by the scale of what is still required. The Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook (GBIO) offers a framework for reaching a much deeper understanding of the world's biodiversity, and through that understanding the means to conserve it better and to use it more sustainably. The GBIO identifies four major focal areas, each with a number of core components, to help coordinate efforts and funding. The co-authors, from a wide range of disciplines, agree these are the essential elements of a global strategy to harness biodiversity data for the common good. In summary, the GBIO proposes actions in the following key areas: 	 •	 Creating	a	culture of shared expertise, robust common data standards, policies and incentives for data sharing and a system of persistent storage and archiving of data. 	 •	 Mobilizing	biodiversity	data from all available sources, to make them promptly and routinely available. Data should be gathered only once, but used many times. This includes data in all forms from historic literature and collections to the observations made by citizen scientists; from the readings of automated sensors to the analysis of the genetic signatures of microbe communities. 	 •	 Providing	the	tools	to	convert	data	into	evidence by enabling those data to be discovered, organizing them into views that give them context and meaning. This includes major collaborative efforts to improve the accuracy of data and their fitness to be used in research and policy; to provide a taxonomic framework; and to organize information about the traits of species and the interactions between them. 	 •	 Generating	understanding of biodiversity and our impacts upon it, by applying the evidence in models, tools for visualization and identifying gaps to prioritize future data gathering. We invite funders, policymakers, researchers, information technology specialists, educators and the general public to unite around the framework detailed in the following pages. The rewards of coordinated action will be as exciting and significant as the great scientific collaborations to advance our understanding of space, the human genome and the fundamental particles of matter.",2013,28/2/2018 6:04,14/3/2023 23:47,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,orca.cf.ac.uk,,not specified,,,,,GS 2013,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\VSKP7XLL\GBIO.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Warwick Open Space is located approximately 13 kilometres north from the Perth Central Business District in the suburb of Warwick. The reserve covers approximately 60 hectares (ha) of bushland, contains Warwick Leisure Centre and Warwick Sports Centre and is bounded by Warwick Road, Wanneroo Road, Beach Road and Erindale Road. Warwick Open Space also surrounds the north, east and south sides of Warwick Senior High School. Warwick Open Space is classified as a Major Conservation Area and is ranked in the City of Joondalup's top five natural areas due to the high biodiversity values of the area. Warwick Open Space contains regionally significant plant communities including Jarrah-Banksia Woodland and has been recognised for its regional environmental significance by being designated as a Bush Forever site (not including the Warwick Senior High School bushland) by the Western Australian Planning Commission in 2000. As part of the development of the Warwick Open Space Bushland Management Plan, a flora, fauna and fungi survey was conducted in spring 2012. The results of this survey were combined with previous surveys undertaken to develop a comprehensive species list and ecological assessment of the site. The majority of the native vegetation on site is in very good or excellent condition and surveys have identified 217 native flora species (including one naturally occurring priority species and three naturally occurring significant species), 69 native fungi species, three native mammals, 64 native birds (including seven species of conservation significance), 16 native reptile species (including one species of conservation significance), two native amphibians, and 34 native invertebrates (including three species of conservation significance). Environmental threats have the potential to degrade natural areas and reduce biodiversity values. Environmental threats addressed in this Plan include weeds, plant diseases, fire, non-native fauna species, human impacts, access and infrastructure. A total of 156 weed species (including four declared plants and one Weed of National Significance), five non-native mammals, five non-native birds and two non-native invertebrates have been identified at Warwick Open Space. A number of fires have occurred in the reserve over the past decade, resulting in some degradation of vegetation. In order to address the key environmental threats at Warwick Open Space a number of management actions are outlined within the Plan. Management actions have been proposed for the next five years and include regular weed control, annual fire fuel load assessments, engaging consultants to undertake flora, weeds, fungi, fauna, bat and invertebrates surveys and implementation of the City's Pathogen Management Plan. The management actions will be implemented in partnership with key stakeholders and community groups, where relevant.",2013,28/2/2018 5:37,23/3/2023 5:20,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Perth, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2013,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\4TXUUX3M\City of Joondalup - Warwick Open Space Bushland Management Plan.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

The field surveys were undertaken during a companion project on reef monitoring, by Kangaroo Island Friend's of the Sea (FotS), an NRM-supported community group which uses a standard marine monitoring method developed by the international Reef Life Survey (RLS) program (Reef Life Survey 2013; Stuart-Smith et al. 2013). Part of the field work aimed to learn more about the distribution of rarely recorded fishes (including endemic fishes) and other fishes of conservation interest in the KI coastal area, so that populations of such species may be better conserved, and protected from threatening processes. Between March 2013 and April 2013, five SACReD divers collectively spent more than 36 hours diving, at 8 subtidal reef sites and 1 jetty within the KI NRM region, and took more than 500 photographs of reef fishes of conservation interest. The field work relates to a project we began in 2007, through which we have aimed to (i) develop a suitable nondestructive technique to search for various uncommon reef fishes (mostly benthic, and many cryptic) throughout South Australia; and (ii) record and photograph such fishes, in order to learn more about their distribution, habitats, and habits. Our target list comprises more than 50 species from 14 families, for which little information is available on full distribution within South Australia. Data on some of the reef fishes of conservation interest were also collected by FotS divers and KI NRM staff and associates, during RLS reef monitoring transects at 10 sites along the north coast of KI. Results have indicated that both targetted searches in the benthos by SACReD divers and RLS transects by KIFOTS provide a better indication of reef fish species composition on Kangaroo island reefs than either method alone. The data gathered during the Kangaroo Island field work in 2013 are providing an ongoing, cumulative body of useful knowledge - for example, presence of particular species of conservation interest at various locations within the range; and habitat requirements and usage. Over time, such information is useful for formal assessments of conservation status of reef fishes of conservation interest at international (e.g. IUCN Red List), national (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) and State (rare and threatened species schedules) scales, and can also assist in the development of management plans to address coastal impacts which may affect populations of such fishes. The data will also assist conservation planning for nearshore reef fish habitats on Kangaroo Island, including management of activities in the zones Kangaroo Island's newly legislated marine parks.",2013,28/2/2018 6:04,23/3/2023 5:25,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,South Australian Conservation Research Divers,"South Australia, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2013,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\23RBJDD5\MARINE_SPECIES_OF_CONSERVATION_INTEREST.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

4F3TXBAK,thesis,2018,"Mayo, Rebecca",Labours of Care: Art Practice and Urban Ecological Restoration,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2184251026?accountid=26957,"This research reveals how an art practice built around ethics of care offers a means of enacting an ecological responsibility. As cities and their human populations continue to grow, urban creeks and green spaces are becoming increasingly important and contested. Habitat loss for non-human species increases the need to care for these places. My volunteer work as a 'Friend of Merri Creek' in Melbourne's northern suburbs, prompted this practice-based research which has explored practices of care as both subject matter and method. I argue that the processual, repetitive and labour-intense nature of my practice are qualities shared by environmental restoration work. This led me to ask: What could my art practice, based in print and textiles, reveal about practices of ecological restoration and degradation at an urban creek? I have set out to explore this question by bringing Merri Creek and my art practice closer together, using the meditative and repetitive acts of walking, weeding, planting, sewing and printing with locally collected plant dye.    Through studio and field-based investigation, I have established a way to observe contemporary and historic actions that have altered the Merri Creek ecosystem. Further, through an exploration of process, repetition and labour, I have found ways to produce artworks that manifest through-and reveal-practices of care. My research culminated in three works, brought together in an installation at Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, together with an exegetical text. Building and departing from feminist debates surrounding an 'ethics of care', I draw on the work of theorists that approach care from materialist, ecological and practice-based standpoints. If care is a way of seeing and acting in the world in which interdependency and relationships are foregrounded and the potential to take responsibility is raised, then my examination of care as practice and method of art, and its interpretation, offers a path through which to navigate an increasingly precarious world.",2018,21/1/2020 3:22,15/1/2021 6:41,,,193,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,2184251026,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\G9ZDI2NW\Mayo - 2018 - Labours of Care Art Practice and Urban Ecological.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

This research takes a theoretically unique approach to exploring participants, participation and non-participation to provide the field of citizen science with new insights to inform recruitment and engagement strategies. Identity theory and social ecology provide a conceptual framework for exploring the relationship between identity and participation, or non-participation, in citizen science. Utilising multiple measures of identity (environmental, technological, scientific, place, social and political) constructed into an instrument designed for this research, over 900 citizen scientists across nine representative citizen science projects in Australia were surveyed, as well as over 1,400 people who had never before participated in citizen science. In addition, the practitioners managing the representative projects were interviewed to understand their strategies and challenges in recruiting and engaging volunteers. The findings illuminate emergent identities in citizen science and reveal related motivations, barriers and other factors that may influence participation. A synthesis of the qualitative and quantitative results provides a critical discussion on entry points to citizen science, modes of participation (i.e. online or face to face), topic diversity (i.e. environmental and non-environmental), recruitment messaging and the identities in citizen science established by this research, including Environmental Stewards, Science Enthusiasts and Newcomers. The proposition arising from this research is that participation in citizen science is fundamentally constrained, for example, a percentage of the population simply seem uninterested in participating. Practitioners are encouraged to understand the identities of their current and future volunteers and engage them accordingly.",2020,12/10/2020 2:26,15/1/2021 6:40,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of South Australia,,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2020,,10.13140/RG.2.2.15691.41766,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\ARKZUWBI\James - 2020 - Identity and Participation in Citizen Science.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

While each field has its own workflows and best practices, the general process can be aided by an e-Science infrastructure. The contribution of this thesis is to support the workflow of the scientists which can be split in four parts: In the first part, we introduce xBook, a framework which aids the creation of database application to collect, back-up, and share data.  In the second part, we describe the synchronization which is a vital part of the xBook framework that, with the use of timestamps, allows data to be entered offline. The data then can be shared with coworkers for analyses or further processing. It also can be used as a backup system to avoid data loss.  Third, we present an architecture allowing data from distributed data sources to be retrieved without a central managing instance. This is achieved with the use of minimal search parameters which are guaranteed to exist in all connected data sources. This architecture is based on the concept of mediators, but gives data owners full control over their data sources as opposed to the traditional mediator where the connected data sources are managed by a central administrator. Fourth we describe an embeddable analysis tool which can be integrated into a base application where the data is gathered. With the aid of simple modules, called ``Workers'', this tool empowers domain experts to easily create analyses particularly designed for their area of work in a familiar working environment. Additionally, we present another tool which allows the graphical display of temporal and spatial information of archaeological excavations. This tool uses an interactive Harris Matrix to order findings temporally and allows the comparison with their spatial location.",2018,26/6/2018 0:35,15/1/2021 6:39,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München,"München, Germany",German,,PhD,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\SCPIZLP7\Lohrer - 2018 - An e-science infrastructure for collecting, sharin.pdf",,5 - ALA mentioned
KHQ278B9,report,2015,"Trocini, S.; Barrett, G.; Howard, K.; Ramalho, C.",Rakali Community Survey 2014-2015. Report prepared by WWF-Australia and the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320912231,"Rakali or Australian water rat (Hydromys chrysogaster) is a cryptic native rodent that is perfectly adapted to the aquatic environment and can be found near fresh or brackish permanent waterbodies and sheltered coastal beaches. Rakali are common and widespread throughout Australia, but have suffered localised declines in Western Australia, in particular the Wheatbelt, due to habitat loss and degradation, drying climate, salinisation and predation by introduced predators. WWF-Australia, in partnership with the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife conducted a widely publicised community survey collecting sighting reports of rakali in Western Australia, in particular from the southwest of the state. Citizen science offers an opportunity to collect monitoring data on a large spatial and temporal scale and to detect changes in frequency and distribution of easily observable threats to wildlife species. Results obtained by citizen science projects such as the Rakali Community Survey can also provide essential baseline data to identify research and management priorities. The aim of this survey was to obtain rakali distribution data and to identify potential threats, while educating the community about this cryptic and understudied native rodent. A total of 234 sightings were reported over four months (December 2014 to March 2015). Additionally, 49 transect surveys were carried out with the help of community volunteers, looking for characteristic rakali foot prints and feeding middens (the Rakali Walk). The described survey methodology was found to be a simple and effective way to monitor the presence of rakali. This technique in association with other survey methods, such as camera trapping, could be utilised to extensively survey sites over time and gather information on relative abundance. The distribution of rakali sightings obtained from the Rakali Community Survey was found to largely overlap with the known species distribution, with the majority of the sightings occurring in the south-west corner of the state and a limited number of sightings in the Wheatbelt. There was also anecdotal evidence of localised declines and extinctions in the Perth Metropolitan Region. For instance, historical rakali distribution data obtained from NatureMap showed that rakali were distributed along the Helena River in the 1960s, but no recent sightings were reported from this location. Besides, only scarce and localised evidence of rakali was found along this river and its tributaries during the transect surveys. The reduction in water levels and flow due to a dam built in the 1970s, in association with habitat degradation, may have contributed to a localised decline along this waterway north-east of Perth. The main reported cause of rakali mortality was attributed to drowning in box or opera-house style traps used to catch freshwater crayfish (in particular marron, Cherax cainii). These crayfish traps, which are illegal to use for recreational marron fishing were also one of the main threats identified by survey participants. Predation by foxes and cats, habitat degradation and changes in hydrology were also identified as important threats. Recommendations highlight the importance of further rakali monitoring in Western Australia and research into the effects of habitat degradation, introduced predators and changes in hydrology on rakali populations. Identified management recommendations include predator control at important sites and the protection and restoration of wetland habitat where the presence of rakali was confirmed. Increased monitoring of the illegal use of crayfish traps throughout Western Australia is also deemed a priority to reduce rakali mortality rates. Education of crayfish fishers and farmers, as well as retailers selling crayfish traps, in association with the promotion of a crayfish trap with an escape hatch recently developed by the Australian Platypus Conservancy will also play an important role in protecting this native species.",2015,28/2/2018 5:37,24/3/2023 0:22,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,WWF-Australia,"Perth, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\8XXIKYTZ\Trocini et al. - 2015 - Rakali Community Survey 2014-2015.

Why an information model for vegetation site data exchange? The Department of the Environment (DoE) Essential Environmental Measures programme (the measures programme) aims to improve availability of data for a range of environmental information products and management processes, including State of the Environment reporting. The program brings together experts to identify measures which are essential for tracking change in the state of our environment, and improve the discovery, access and reuse of data and information under those measures. The programme is being piloted with the native vegetation community. A working group of native vegetation experts is developing a set of native vegetation measures. This project was undertaken to improve the discovery, access and reuse of data under the native vegetation measures being developed. A vegetation site data custodian identified an opportunity for the Essential Environmental Measures program to facilitate development of a national vegetation site data exchange standard. This standard is important to enable reliable, efficient integration of data from a range of custodians, including state and territory organisations and aggregators such as the Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network (TERN) and the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).",2016,28/2/2018 5:36,24/3/2023 0:43,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,CSIRO Land and Water Flagship,"Canberra, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\XTDBIKN5\Box et al. - 2016 - Vegetation Site Data-Information model and data ex.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

In the first chapter, we investigate the effects of biological invasion by Acacia spp., fire and eucalyptus disturbance, and land-use on a neglected sandy-savanna ecosystem named Mussununga; in the second, we tested the effects of landscape functioning and structure in the Acacia invasion in Mussununga ecosystem; and finally, assessed the potential distribution of Acacia mangium and A. auriculiformis in five climate scenarios and the potential effects in restoration programs. We found in the first chapter that Acacia promoted changes in the structure and phytophysiognomie of the woody layer, but did not affect the herb-shrub layer. On the other hand, anthropogenic factors affected both woody and herb-shrub layer. In the second chapter, we found that in a fragmented landscape with the higher road network, Mussununga has a higher chance to be invaded by Acacia. Shape index had a negative effect in Acacia invasion, while the length of roads, Mussununga size, Mussununga perimeter, length of highways and landscape conductance had a positive effect. Finally, in the third chapter, we found A. mangium has a large suitable area in all scenarios, while A auriculiformis is confined to a relatively small region of 13,083 km 2 (+/- 3.39 SD). In the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), the suitable area for A. mangium expanded from the current scenario of 18.4% of the Atlantic Forest to 24.0% in the year 2050, while, achieved around 44,3% of the Atlantic Forest area in the worse scenarios (RCP 8.2, in 2070). Still in the scenarios with higher climatic change, the suitable area for A. mangium overlapped around 39.3% of the potential area for restoration programs, in Atlantic Forest.",2018,23/8/2018 1:34,15/1/2021 6:36,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Universidade Federal de Vicosa,Brazil,English,,PhD,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\LKPZJ5BS\Heringer - 2018 - Biological invasion by Acacia spp. in the Brazilia.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Biological collections are the repository for this biodiversity information and there is a strong track record of the knowledge generated from these collections improving sustainable food production and ultimately food security. However, the way these collections are used, and indeed what they are comprised of, is undergoing rapid change. The collections themselves are moving from repositories of our flora and fauna to warehouses of species data, spatial ecosystem models, digital images, tissues, genetic sequences and information. Furthermore, our tools include genomics and informatics which provide an explosion of information that we now can mine in new ways we have never been able to do before. One example is the Atlas of Living Australia that will bring together all relevant biological knowledge of Australia's biota. But we need to do more, including using automation to harvest new knowledge and insights.

The management and regulation of invasive plants are facilitated using screening tools, such as weed risk assessments (WRAs) to predict the invasive potential of non-native plants. The identification of these species and their subsequent regulation on importation helps to reduce the risk of future ecosystem and economic costs. Globally, there are many different types of highly useful WRAs already available. However, in this day of big data and powerful predictive analytics, there is an increasing demand for the development of new and more robust screening tools. In this thesis, I use the machine learning algorithm, Random forests, to develop a new WRA. I show that random forest model has greater predictive accuracies than an existing logistic regression model and that random forest is a better learner. In addition, variable importance analysis was performed to identify factors associated with invasive status classification of non-native plants. The study suggests that random forests make powerful weed risk screening tools and should be utilized for assessing invasive risk potential along with other WRAs. An integrative approach for evaluating weed risk can greatly serve to facilitate the WRA process.",2018,21/1/2020 3:22,15/1/2021 6:24,,,140,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"University of Maryland, College Park",Ann Arbor,English,,M.S.,,2193739603,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\KM4MC7ST\Harris - 2018 - A Comparative Analysis of Random Forest and Logist.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

However, the indirect impacts of climate on aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood. The aim of this thesis is to better understand how aquatic ecosystems respond to past climate change, using two lakes in western Tasmania as case studies. Palaeoecological research on two multiproxy lake sediment records (Paddy's Lake and Lake Vera) were used to reconstruct chronology (radiometric dating, i.e. 14C); fire regimes (charcoal); vegetation dynamics (pollen); nutrient dynamics (C%, N%, C/N, δ13C, and δ15N); catchment geochemistry (µXRF scanning); and aquatic response (diatoms and cladocerans) to determine the impact of climate change on these aquatic ecosystems. Results from Paddy's Lake reveal long-term changes in the cladoceran community are indirectly driven by climate through changing vegetation productivity and available 14N altering the trophic status of the lake. Following the invasion of sclerophyll vegetation caused by increased fire frequency, the indirect climate influences on the aquatic system break down and the cladocerans appear complacent to changing vegetation productivity. At Lake Vera, diatoms respond indirectly to climate through changes in the acidity and dystrophic conditions of the lake with catchment peat formation. An increase in climate variability at ca. 5 ka caused declines in lake level resulting in a shift to a direct response in the diatoms to climate. During a period of increased drying at ca. 2.4 to 0.7 ka, increased fire activity adversely impacts the aquatic system causing a non-linear transition in the diatom community. The findings from this thesis show aquatic ecosystems of Tasmania are predominantly indirectly driven by climate through the formation of thick organic peats. Shifts in vegetation composition alter the surrounding soils and catchment dynamics impacting aquatic ecosystems trophic status and pH. Fire is another important driver of aquatic ecosystem response that causes changes in vegetation composition, altering the nutrient profile of soils and increasing erosion and sediment delivery. Aquatic ecosystems respond with increased pH, disturbance taxa and a shallowing of lake mixing depth in the diatom community. These terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem interactions have the potential to be more widespread across Southern Hemisphere biomes and temperate peatlands worldwide that share similar vegetation-soil dynamics.",2018,2/10/2018 23:46,15/1/2021 6:24,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Univeristy of Melbourne,Melbourne,English,,PhD,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\HQYMFCSG\Beck - 2018 - Direct and indirect effects of long-term climatic .pdf,,2 - ALA cited

They have been employed as feature trees in private and public gardens as well as street trees lining avenues and boulevards. P canariensis has seen the most rapid and widespread uptake and today is distributed globally in warm temperate zones (Spennemann, 2018c).

As part of this, they are hoping to improve their public profile, both with other scientific disciplines and in the wider community. Within the wider community, taxonomists would like to target individuals in the age range of 20-70 as well as nature enthusiasts. Although very broad, this is who they think can have the greatest impact on their long-term goal of convincing governments to increase funding for the discipline. Taxonomists have limited time and money but could utilise a student enrolled in a Science Communication Practicum unit from various universities. To fulfil the objectives, taxonomists must first learn what the target audience's attitudes, awareness and interest towards taxonomy currently are. We suggest conducting an online survey using the Likert scales to gain a baseline measurement. In addition, employed taxonomists should be surveyed to measure their expectations of the audience's response for comparison. Research strongly suggests it's fundamental for taxonomists to have a social media presence in today's society. Facebook is the platform used by the highest percentage of Australian residents compared to other social media platforms. This is consistent across all age groups within the target audience, making it the most appropriate choice. As the audience is spending an average of 10 hours a week on this platform, with the average time per visit being 23 minutes, we suggest a two-part strategy on Facebook consisting of a monthly photo competition and a 30-second video series. In addition, we suggest using Facebook to raise awareness of the other strategies, as well as sharing posts from other pages to sustain a level of content that maintains taxonomists social media presence. For all of the strategies discussed, it would be beneficial for the taxonomists of Australasia to design a logo, as this will help in establishing an identity. To increase positive views towards taxonomy, research has shown collaborations are very beneficial. There are many disciplines of science limited in their research due to the incomplete taxonomic knowledge of all species. We suggest holding video conferences with these disciplines to provide an opportunity to initialise collaborations and discuss important topics in taxonomy. Finally, we recommend conducting a citizen science project specifically around taxonomy and biosystematics. This will enable the wider public to become more involved and taxonomists to gain more data.",2018,12/10/2020 2:34,23/3/2023 3:18,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Western Australia,"Perth, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\EVUSFJXX\Redgate et al. - 2018 - Giving Taxonomists a name in society - A communica.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed

The project aim was to assess the effectiveness of revegetation and corridors, land management actions and the establishment of ecological linkages projects in the Southern Wheatbelt on the region's unique fauna. This project focussed on the Dongolocking Catchment, the site of a major conservation project undertaken between 1996 and 2005 where the focal species approach was used to inform broad scale revegetation activities designed to optimise wildlife habitat for a broad range of species. The knowledge gained through this research will be used to increase the capacity of the regional practitioners, agencies, local governments and the Natural Resource Management (NRM) community to better plan and undertake successful restoration projects that contribute to fauna conservation, including critical weight range fauna.

P3YEGK85,report,2018,"Glatz, R.; Marsh, J.; Young, D.A.",Banrock Station Invertebrate Survey: water-related invertebrates and their association with environmental flooding. Brief report of initial survey.,,,,,,"In late 2017, Accolade Wines contracted D'Estrees Entomology to undertake an invertebrate biosurvey of Banrock Station including the Ramsar-listed wetlands occurring on the property. The broad goal of the first year of sampling (December 2017-December 2018) is to provide an initial assessment of the invertebrate biodiversity of various habitat types on Banrock Station. A more specific goal was to assess water-associated invertebrates and their association with different aquatic habitats including those created by environmental watering (E-watering or E-flooding), which is intended to mimic the natural flooding events as far as possible. In this context, we define water-association as having one part of the life cycle obligately occurring in aquatic environments or being largely found in aquatic or damp habitats. One aim of such an assessment is to develop a sampling protocol to monitor the biodiversity of water-associated species and the effects that flooding and drying have on these species. This is important because flooding cycles would affect many hundreds of invertebrate species, which themselves are key for many ecological functions such as pollination. As of May 2018, three survey trips have been conducted; 13-16 December 2017, 27 February-2 March 2018, and 19-22 April 2018. This report provides some preliminary information about the water-associated invertebrates surveyed on these trips. It should be noted that many samples have only undergone sorting and are yet to be classified. Other samples are being assessed by various experts. Therefore, the information provided within is incomplete in its scope and preliminary in terms of findings.",2018,30/8/2018 5:25,23/3/2023 3:39,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,D’Estrees Entomology & Science Services,"Kingscote, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\KE9TMBHG\Glatz et al. - 2018 - Banrock Station Invertebrate Survey water-related.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

UMV5QEL6,thesis,2019,"Smith, P.A.",Stimulation of Western Australian Sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) oil production using multiple treatments,,,,,https://ro.ecu.edu.au/theses/2202,"Sandalwood is an important international commodity, recognised for its aromatic oil which is a key ingredient in many fragrances and cosmetics. Western Australian (WA) sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) is known to be a cheaper alternative for the superior Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) as it has a lower oil content and lower quality oil. The natural stocks of S. album have declined due to illegal poaching, mismanagement, and disease. WA sandalwood's natural stands have also reduced due to historical mismanagement. As a result, WA sandalwood (S. spicatum) has been established in plantations in the southern half of WA to attempt to meet the demands of the sandalwood industry. Plantation WA sandalwood is promoted to farmers as agroforestry, with the promise of economic and environmental benefits. While these benefits are attractive, sandalwood has an estimated 25 year rotation. This research aimed to determine the effect of physical and chemical treatments on oil production and heartwood formation in WA sandalwood, with the aim being to increase oil production, thus allowing the time between establishment and harvesting to be reduced. This study was conducted over three plantations in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia; 'Sandawindy', 'Kylie Reserve', and 'Brookton'. At each site, four treatments were applied: a dowel soaked with the plant hormone Methyl Salicylate (MeSA) and inserted into the tree (Treated Dowel treatment), a dowel with no MeSA inserted into the tree (Blank Dowel treatment), a drill hole left empty (Empty Drill treatment), and a section of bark removed from the tree (Bark Removed treatment), as well as a group of trees left as a control for comparison. The Blank Dowel and Empty Drill treatments were established to determine if any significant increases of sandalwood oil in the Treated Dowel treatment were a result of the MeSA, the foreign dowel, or drilling into the tree. The Bark Removed treatment was used to mimic drysidedness; a condition that occurs naturally in the Rangelands of WA as a result of sun scald. The sandalwood trees were measured and treated in November of 2016. Plantations were divided into 30 evenly sized blocks per site, with 6 replicate blocks allocated to each treatment and control group. Two replicate blocks for every treatment and control group at each plantation were harvested in November of 2017, and all trees were remeasured. Of the approximate 300 trees harvested, 150 were cored using a 12 mm auger drill. These core samples were analysed for oil yield and composition at Wescorp's laboratory. The total oil was measured an analysed, as well as the oil constituents α-santalol, β-santalol, farnesol, nuciferol, and β-bisabalol oil compositions (percentage) and yield (%w/w). All trees that were harvested ii were cut into 8 discs measuring 25 mm each, and the percentage of heartwood area at each height was measured and recorded. All data was statistically analysed using a univariate general linear model. There was no treatment that consistently increased total oil or oil component yields, qualities, or heartwood area percentages. The Empty Drill treatment resulted in more oil production than the control group on the most occasions, however it did not consistently increase oil production. This showed that the presence of MeSA did not have a significant effect on oil production, and the physical wounding of the tree had the overall greatest effect. The Kylie Reserve plantation showed low oil yield and low heartwood area percentages compared to the Sandawindy and Brookton plantations, although also showed the highest oil yields. This research, while not showing significant increases in oil production for the different treatments used, has giving a promising indication that a longer time between treatment and harvesting could influence the oil production. Further research extending this study should be conducted to give more information on the effect of the treatments on oil production.",2019,11/6/2019 2:47,14/3/2023 3:50,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Edith Cowan University,"Western Australia, Australia",not specified,,Masters,,,GS 2019,,DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2020.1728470,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\V36Q2RRB\Smith - 2019 - Stimulation of Western Australian Sandalwood (Sant.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

In 2014 a dataset with 30 535 records was published in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Since then data has been improved and new records acquired. Currently, the collection catalogue includes 39 139 validated records, corresponding to 79 885 specimens, with much more to be added from collections donated by private collectors or unprocessed samples. The data for these specimens was cleaned, formatted and geocoded and published on the GBIF. During this work, different APIs were tested to allow automated geocoding of sampling locations. Google Maps achieved the best results, with 57.6% of results within 1000 m of the correct location. A citizen science project was developed and tested to accelerate the digitization process, including two workflows with different objectives. One was focused on the transcription of specimen label data, which resulted in the data for 130 specimens being successfully transcribed. The other was focused on the taxonomic identification of specimens from photographs, directed to specialists in the respective group's taxonomy, which resulted in 61 new identifications and the verification of identifications for the remaining 69 specimens. The MNHNC and IICT collections contain collections of horseflies (Order Diptera, Family Tabanidae) which are of particular importance due to its size and completeness of associated data. Horseflies are widely distributed worldwide and are important vectors in transmission of diseases to humans and cattle. The IICT collection includes a sub-collection which was compiled and studied by J. A. Travassos Santos Dias, a prominent specialist in this group. The specimens in these collections were photographed, all the associated data were transcribed, taxonomic identifications were verified and records were geocoded, resulting in a dataset of 1666 specimens. These specimens were collected between 1899 and 2018, mainly in Portugal, but also in Sao Tome and Principe, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Spain and other countries.

No one institution has the entire range of collection types or is ever likely to. This diversity among institutions and their collections is a societal strength-especially as collections are joined in working"" (Rakow, Lee, & Raven, 2011). This statement describes the importance of thinking beyond individual garden collections to achieve a greater impact. Regular analysis of a sub-group of plant taxa in this context of representation in regional or global collections allows for a more robust assessment of that specified taxa. Whereas individual arboreta and botanic gardens ensure their collections meet the goals of their Living Collections Policies, networks such as the Plant Collections Network (previously called the National Accredited Plant Collections Consortium), or the Botanic Gardens Conservation International ensure that plant groups are represented with depth amongst a network of arboreta and botanic gardens (Rakow et al., 2011).For this investigation the subgroup chosen for assessment was the Hamamelidaceae. The goals of this thesis were to (1) reconcile the nomenclature and taxonomy for the family, (2) research and summarize descriptions for each species, (3) note local and global conservation concerns, (4) assess what members of the Hamamelidaceae are in living collections, and (5) create a cultivar checklist for the family. This research provides institutions with an evaluation of the current state of the Hamamelidaceae in global living collections, and can be used to determine if certain taxa should be targeted for inclusion in individual or joint living collections strategies that ultimately aid in ex situ conservation.",2019,21/1/2020 3:22,16/1/2021 3:30,,,382,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Delaware,Ann Arbor,English,,M.S.,,2307786433,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\WYWIYCN4\Meholic - 2019 - Assessment of the Hamamelidaceae in Global Living .pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show a unique potential for achieving non-disruptive surveys of marine mammal populations on offshore islands. This technology allows scientists to access and collect information in coastal environments that would otherwise not be possible. UAVs capture quick and continuous high-resolution data across the entirety of a site, often at a reduced cost and risk compared to light aircraft and satellite technologies. Situated 1.35 km off the coast of Port Kembla, Martin Islet is a haul-out site for the vulnerable Australian and Long-nosed fur seals. Haul-out sites are important for these species as they allow seals to rest when foraging and avoid predation. This study aimed to investigate temporal variation, spatial distribution and habitat suitability of the fur seal population at Martin Islet. UAV and boat surveys were completed each month from March to August, with additional, more frequent, aerial surveys conducted every two hours to investigate diurnal haul-out behaviour. An evaluation of in-situ and aerial techniques for surveying seals was conducted to determine the most appropriate methodology for Martin Islet. To statistically evaluate the uncertainty associated with counting seals from visual RGB images and thermal infrared images, seal counts were made by two groups of volunteers on an RGB and thermal image respectively.",2019,2/3/2020 0:29,16/1/2021 3:23,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Wollongong,"Wollongong, N.S.W.",English,,Honours,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\NIMNQ4YD\Esteban - The use of unmanned aerial vehicles to assess the .pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Despite the important benefits to using this multi-dimensional approach, especially in the context of rapid climate and land use change, regional-scale conservation initiatives continue to consider taxonomic diversity alone within their strategies. My general objective is to inform biodiversity conservation efforts in the Okanagan Ecoregion by quantifying and documenting, for the first time, current and future geographic patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity among the region's vascular plant assemblages. My specific objectives are to: 1) Use species distribution models to predict current and future distributions of plant species inhabiting the Okanagan Ecoregion; 2) Quantify, map and compare current taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity patterns and hotspots in the Okanagan Ecoregion and compare to the current protected area network; and 3) Use climate projections to assess how future patterns and hotspots of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity may differ from current. Using a reproducible protocol, I produced current and future species distribution models for 1,541 plant species. I then used three plant traits that represent the ecological variation of plant life history strategies as well as a recently published phylogeny to quantify and map patterns of functional and phylogenetic diversity for plant assemblages in the Okanagan Ecoregion. Overall, I found that there was significant geographic variation between patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. While current functional and phylogenetic diversity hotspots had the greatest amount of congruence, hotspots of species richness and functional diversity had essentially no congruence. With future climate projections, all hotspots showed significant decreases in congruence. Elevation became more positively correlated with all three diversity measures in the future, indicating that plant diversity may be shifting to higher elevation areas in response to climate change. The novel findings I provide here concerning patterns of functional and phylogenetic diversity should complement the taxonomic diversity patterns that inform conservation efforts in the Okanagan Ecoregion.",2019,9/1/2019 2:35,16/1/2021 3:21,9/1/2019 2:35,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of British Columbia,,English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.14288/1.0375860,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\D2C6RK6Z\Chelick - 2019 - Predicting taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic .pdf",,5 - ALA mentioned

The associated uncertainty information leads to a quantifiable level of confidence in both the data and the science informing decisions produced using the data. The current breadth and cross-domain depth of understanding and application of uncertainty information, however, are still evolving as the practices associated with quantifying and characterizing uncertainty across various types of Earth observation data are diverse. Since its re-establishment in 2015, the Information Quality Cluster (IQC) of the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) has convened numerous sessions within the auspices of ESIP and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to help collect expert-level information focusing on key aspects of uncertainty of Earth science data and addressed key concerns such as: 1) how uncertainty is quantified (UQ) and characterized (UC), 2) understanding the strengths and limitations of common techniques used in producing and evaluating uncertainty information, 3) implications using uncertainty information as a quality indicator 4) impacts of uncertainty on data fusion/assimilation, 5) various methods for documenting and conveying the uncertainty information to data users, and 6) understanding why certain user communities care about uncertainty and others do not. A key recommendation and action item from the ESIP Summer Meeting 2017 was for the IQC to develop a white paper to establish a clearer understanding of the concept of uncertainty and its communication to data users.

The proposed disturbance footprint on the playa surface has an area of ca. 757ha which is c. 3.6% of the playa.

Test plant species have been selected based on their phylogenetic relationship to the target weed, according to the centrifugal phylogenetic method (Briese 2003; Gilbert et al. 2013; Wapshere, 1974). This method is underpinned by evidence that specialist herbivores are evolutionarily more likely to feed on non-target species closely related to the target weed relative to species that are more distantly related. Within such a phylogenetic/evolutionary framework, an ecological emphasis is also placed on endemic species, species of economic importance and those that are likely to overlap biogeographically with the target weed, where possible. The list has been developed in consultation with plant systematist Dr Tanya Scharaschkin, who advised on relationships within the order Sapindales to which the Anacardiaceae belongs.

It currently shares nearly eight million occurrence records and more than 5000 species pages about Costa Rican vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes, plants, and fungi. These pages contain information elements pertaining to, for instance, morphological descriptions, distribution, habitat, conservation status, management, nomenclature, and multimedia (Vargas et al. 2018). In order to fully integrate species pages into the ALA architecture, CRBio is working in the adoption of the Biodiversity Information Explorer (BIE), an ALA module which manages taxonomic and species contents by integrating global resources like EOL or Wikipedia. This adoption includes the required modifications to use the data model of the Plinian Core (https://github.com/tdwg/PlinianCore), a TDWG draft standard registered as an IPT extension, oriented to share species level information from local and regional sources too (Pando 2018). The advancement of Plinian Core has been lead by INBio, the Spanish Node of GBIF (GBIF Spain), the University of Granada (UG, Spain), the Alexander von Humboldt Institute (IAvH, Colombia), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (Conabio, Mexico) and the University of Sao Paulo (USP, Brazil). This group reviewed the existing data standards to reuse as many elements as possible and avoid redundancy. Besides the aforementioned, Plinian Core is currently used by other institutions like the Chilean Ministry of Environment. Plinian Core was designed to be easy to use, self-contained, able to support data integration from multiple databases, and having the ability to handle different levels of granularity. These requirements are the result of actual needs from content creators that, through an iterative process, have yielded a more complete and flexible exchange standard to aggregate biological and non-biological species information, used by others like IBIN, the Indian Bioresource Information Network (Saran et al. 2018). Plinian Core aims to be a component in producing multiple species catalogues developed under specific constraints to serve specific purposes, instead of focusing on a unified platform while facilitating consistent aggregation and re-utilization of information (GBIF.org 2015). We will present our implementation of the BIE module in the Atlas of Living Costa Rica, following the documented best practices when sharing species level information using Plinian Core. Our demonstration will detail our lessons learned from merging the aforementioned 5000 species pages provided by INBio with several thousand of species pages assembled from the information provided by the World Flora Online through the aggregation of different Flora resources, like Manual de Plantas de Costa Rica (Hammel et al. 2003) that provides 5,000 plants descriptions and 350 vernacular names (http://www.worldfloraonline.org/resource?query=Manual+de+Plantas+de+Costa+Rica).",2019,19/6/2019 4:02,16/1/2021 2:31,,e35474,,,3,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Leiden, Netherlands",English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.3897/biss.3.35474,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\7MQGTNU7\Vargas et al. - 2019 - Sharing Species Pages in the Atlas of Living Costa.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed

With data entry from the specimen labels on herbarium sheets identified as the rate-limiting step in the digitisation workflow, the majority of specimens are databased with minimal data (filing name and geographical region), leaving a need to add further label data (collector, collecting locality, collection date etc.) to make the specimens research ready. We are exploring a number of different ways to complete data entry for specimens that have been imaged. These have included Optical Character Recognition (OCR), to identify meaningful specimen groupings to increase the speed of data entry and more recently citizen science platforms to provide accurate crowd-sourced transcriptions of specimen label data. We sent specimen images of the Australian flowering plants held at RBGE herbarium to DigiVol (https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/21309224), the citizen science platform developed alongside The Atlas of Living Australia. In 29 expeditions, 156 citizen scientists completed collection label data entry for RBGE's 41,000 specimens of Australian flowering plants. We found that 95% of the transcriptions were completed by less than a third (27%) of the volunteers. Of the four volunteer experience levels in DigiVol we found that the middle two, Collection Managers and Scientists, transcribed fewer specimens, but also made fewer mistakes. We found that by removing the filing name from the information provided with the expedition the number of errors in the Museum Details section of the transcription decreased, as the filing name was often added as the label name, regardless of whether this is the case. The feedback we provided for each expedition was used to highlight common errors to try and reduce their occurrence as well as to inform the volunteers of what their transcriptions had revealed about this part of the collection. We explore the citizen science transcription workflow, its rate-limiting steps and how we have worked to include the citizen science and OCR data on our online herbarium catalogue.",2019,19/6/2019 4:08,15/1/2021 7:13,,e37093,,,3,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Leiden, Netherlands",English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.3897/biss.3.37093,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\JRIWLHTN\King and Drinkwater - 2019 - Utilising the Crowd to Unlock the Data on Herbariu.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

In Australia, a suite of digital infrastructures has been developed for environmental sciences to enhance our understanding of the natural world and making forward projections into novel conditions (e.g. Atlas of Living Australia, Biodiver sity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory, ecocloud, Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network). To provide users with a holistic approach to environmental spatial data discovery and analysis, these infrastructures have joined forces to deliver an exciting and innovative new training program.

As a node participant of Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) since 2011, it has participated actively in several projects including the Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) programme. GBIF facilitates collaboration between nodes at different levels through its Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP). One of the actions included in the CESP guidelines is called 'Mentoring activities'. Its main goal is the transfer of knowledge between partners, such as information, technologies, experience, and best practices. Sharing architecture and development is the key solution to solving some the technical challenges and impediments (e.g. hosting, staff turnover, etc.) that GBIF nodes occasionally face. The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) team have developed a feature called 'data hub', which allows the creation of a standalone website with a dedicated occurrence search engine that supports data discovery (e.g. specific genus, geographic area) published by particular GBIF nodes. In 2017, a CESP project between the GBIF Benin and the GBIF France led to the creation of a new portal: Atlas of Living Beninises. This portal shared the same back-end database as the Atlas of Living France portal, while at the same time, each portal displayed and managed information relevant only to its region. In 2018, another CESP project between GBIF France and GBIF Togo shared the same goal as the previous one: implement a new Atlas of Living Australia portal for Togo. This goal will be fulfilled using a similar implementation as the previous project: a shared back-end and different front-end.

To do so, biodiversity research increasingly relies on the use of digital products and services such as raw data archiving systems (e.g. structured databases or data repositories), ready-to-use datasets (e.g. cleaned and harmonized files with normalized measurements or computed trends) as well as associated analytical tools (e.g. model scripts in Github). Several world-wide initiatives facilitate the open access to biodiversity data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) or GenBank, Predicts etc. Although these pave the way towards major advances in biodiversity research, they also typically deliver data products that are sometimes poorly informative as they fail to capture the genuine ecological information they intend to grasp. In other words, access to ready-to-use aggregated data products may sacrifice ecological relevance for data harmonization, resulting in over-simplified, ill-advised standard formats. This is singularly true when the main challenge is to match complementary data (large diversity of measured variables, integration of different levels of life organizations etc.) collected with different requirements and scattered in multiple databases. Improving access to raw data, and meaningful detailed metadata and analytical tools associated with standardized workflows is critical to maintain and maximize the generic relevance of ecological data. Consequently, advancing the design of digital products and services is essential for interoperability while also enhancing reproducibility and transparency in biodiversity research. To go further, a minimal common framework organizing biodiversity observation and data organization is needed. In this regard, the Essential Biodiversity Variable (EBV) concept might be a powerful way to boost progress toward this goal as well as to connect research communities worldwide. As a national Biodiversity Observation Network (BON) node, the French BON is currently embodied by a national research e-infrastructure called ""Pole national de donnees de biodiversite"" (PNDB, formerly ECOSCOPE), aimed at simultaneously empowering the quality of scientific activities and promoting networking within the scientific community at a national level. Through the PNDB, the French BON is working on developing biodiversity data workflows oriented toward end services and products, both from and for a research perspective. More precisely, the two pillars of the PNDB are a metadata portal and a workflow-oriented web platform dedicated to the access of biodiversity data and associated analytical tools (Galaxy-E). After four years of experience, we are now going deeper into metadata specification, dataset descriptions and data structuring through the extensive use of Ecological Metadata Language (EML) as a pivot format. Moreover, we evaluate the relevance of existing tools such as Metacat/Morpho and DEIMS-SDR (Dynamic Ecological Information Management System - Site and dataset registry) in order to ensure a link with other initiatives like Environmental Data Initiative, DataOne and Long-Term Ecological Research related observation networks. Regarding data analysis, an open-source Galaxy-E platform was launched in 2017 as part of a project targeting the design of a citizen science observation system in France (""65 Millions d'observateurs""). Here, we propose to showcase ongoing French activities towards global challenges related to biodiversity information and knowledge dissemination. We particularly emphasize our focus on embracing the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data principles Wilkinson et al. 2016 across the development of the French BON e-infrastructure and the promising links we anticipate for operationalizing EBVs. Using accessible and transparent analytical tools, we present the first online platform allowing the performance of advanced yet user-friendly analyses of biodiversity data in a reproducible and shareable way using data from various data sources, such as GBIF, Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), eBIRD, iNaturalist and environmental data such as climate data.",2019,25/8/2019 23:17,15/1/2021 7:11,,e39215,,,3,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Leiden, Netherlands",English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.3897/biss.3.39215,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\SZ677DQZ\Bras et al. - 2019 - From Raw Biodiversity Data to Indicators, Boosting.pdf",,5 - ALA mentioned

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) constitutes the western margin of the Coral Sea and supports extensive submerged reef systems in mesophotic depths. The majority of research on the GBR has focused on Scleractinian corals, although other taxa (e.g., fishes) are receiving increasing attention. To date, 192 coral species (44% of the GBR total) are recorded from mesophotic depths, most of which occur shallower than 60 m. East of the Australian continental margin, the Queensland Plateau contains many large, oceanic reefs. Due to their isolated location, Australia's Coral Sea reefs remain poorly studied; however, preliminary investigations have confirmed the presence of mesophotic coral ecosystems, and the clear, oligotrophic waters of the Coral Sea likely support extensive mesophotic reefs. Although mesophotic reefs in the GBR and Coral Sea are among the best-studied globally, most research has focused on only a few sites, and research effort dedicated to mesophotic coral ecosystems remains negligible compared to shallow-water reefs. Despite the lack of ecological data from most mesophotic reef habitats, precautionary management approaches that explicitly considered latitudinal and cross-shelf gradients in the environment resulted in mesophotic reefs being well-represented in no-take areas in the GBR.

The importance of taxonomic clarity of the large ocean sunfishes (genus Mola, Family Molidae) for assessing sunfish vulnerability to anthropogenic pressures.",,,,,http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/41666/,"The study of ocean sunfishes has for decades been practically synonymous with the study of Mola mola, recently listed as 'vulnerable' on a global scale by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The concerns are high levels of fisheries bycatch worldwide, however sunfish bycatch is rarely identified to species level anywhere, perhaps as a long legacy of taxonomic confusion in the sunfish taxonomy has rendered identification to species level challenging. This includes the Australian and New Zealand longline fisheries, where sunfishes are listed at ""High Risk"" due to data deficiency. In the popular sunfish SCUBA dive tourism off Bali, Indonesia, another type of anthropogenic pressure is manifested through diver crowding, preventing sunfish from interacting with cleaner-fish on the local reefs. The consequences are difficult to gauge due to a paucity of information on this highly seasonal phenomenon, but have motivated discussions of sunfish protection by Indonesian authorities.  In this study, the species identities and zoogeographies of the little studied sunfishes in Australia and New Zealand were explored through biopsy sampling in the longline fisheries, and by reviewing museum collections across both countries. Specimen IDs were established phylogenetically and/or morphologically. Combined, the results revealed a new species of ocean sunfish, Mola tecta, which was diagnosed and described. Furthermore, the results showed that three large species of sunfish dominate the tropical, subtropical/warmtemperate and cold-temperate waters of Australia and New Zealand; Masturus lanceolatus, Mola alexandrini and Mola tecta, respectively. Mola mola appears to be rare. These results imply that the long-term fisheries observer sunfish bycatch data from both countries consists of a mix of species. Bycatch rate analyses within four fishing grounds sub-areas, each presumably dominated by one species of sunfish, did not reveal downwards trends over the 10 - 12 year periods, for which data were available.  In the Bali tourism industry, the sunfish species identity was confirmed molecularly and morphologically as Mola alexandrini. The strong seasonality in diver sightings was documented through sunfish encounter rates based on operator logs. The results revealed that the 2015 sunfish season (August - October/November) lagged by ~1 month the seasonal change in intensity of two major oceanographic features of the area, established from in situ and satellite sea surface temperature data. Data from eight satellite tagged sunfish revealed a high affinity by four fish to the dynamic Lombok Straight during the sunfish season, however, at least one other fish left the area. Overall, temperature emerged as an unlikely main driver of the sunfish seasonality, which is instead presumably driven by an increase in sunfish prey availability, associated with the seasonal cold-water upwelling.  Overall, these findings have provided much needed clarity to the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of the genus Mola, and demonstrated the need for species-level investigations of fisheries bycatch globally to inform fisheries risk assessments. Furthermore, the results provided important information on the sunfish seasonality off Bali to inform tourism management decisions.",2018,17/8/2018 0:21,15/1/2021 6:42,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Murdoch University,,English,,PhD,,,GS 2018,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\LD2ANBX7\Nyegaard - 2018 - There be giants!

Using examples ranging from kangaroos and platypuses to kiwis and birds of paradise, the book examines the patterns of distribution and evolution of Australasian biodiversity and explains them with reference to tectonic and climatic change in the region. The surprising results from molecular biogeography demonstrate that an understanding of evolution in Australasia is essential for understanding the development of modern life on Earth.

Indicus, and its Position in the Drosophilidae Phylogeny",,,,,http://scholarbank.nus.sg/handle/10635/121263,"Not all species of Drosophilidae have larvae that feed on rotting fruits and plant matter. One such larvae that has be claimed to be a predator of whitefly is from the genus Acletoxenus. This was proved to be true where I provide the first video evidence of predation by a Singapore Acletoxenus species on Aleurotrachelus trachoides. I demonstrated that the larvae have morphological adaptations for predation because the cephaloskeleton lacks the pharyngeal filter and a developed facial mask. Furthermore, I showed that the morphological features that have been traditionally used for distinguishing Acletoxenus species (colour patterns on mesonotum) vary across individuals of one population and conclude that the Singapore species is most likely Acletoxenus cf. indicus. I studied the natural history of Acletoxenus cf. indicus and find it to have a long development time of 24 days. It was also commonly parasitized by Pachyneuron leucopiscida (43% of puparia). Through performing a comparative analysis of larva transcriptomics, I found that the relatively highly expressed genes in Acletoxenus cf. indicus are involved in odorant reception, chitin metabolism, alkaloid biosynthesis, and producing glue for pupation. The results also imply that many genes that are only moderately expressed in Acletoxenus cf. indicus are relatively high expressed in Drosophila melanogaster homeostasis and development. Lastly, I tested whether the phylogenetic relationships of Drosophilidae can be resolved using NCBI GenBank data so that I can place Acletoxenus on the tree of life. Two methods (supermatrix and supertree) were used but the results were not satisfactory in terms of resolution, support, and congruence with the existing classification. The relationships obtained for the Steganinae were very different from previously published phylogenies while there is better congruence for the Drosophilinae. Acletoxenus cf. indicus was found to be in a ""basal"" position in the maximum likelihood analyses while it is nested in a clade consisting of Gitonini and Colocasiomyia in the maximum parsimony analyses. I conclude that the available data in GenBank are currently insufficient for obtaining a well-resolved and supported phylogenetic hypothesis for Drosophilidae.",2015,28/2/2018 6:05,14/3/2023 23:31,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,National University of Singapore,,not specified,,Master,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\YYI7XDIU\Jinfa - 2015 - The Natural History and Comparative Transcriptomic.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

May 2014",,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:344429,"Biodiversity is threatened globally by a range of anthropogenic impacts on the extent, connectedness and intactness of habitats required for species persistence. The emergence and expansion of energy industries, such as Coal Seam Gas, into many farming regions, will compound existing threats to biodiversity in a region, and also bring new ones. This is particularly so in multiple-use regions where new threats can have synergistic and cumulative effects on the biodiversity. Multiple-use regions are often heavily cleared and fragmented making it impractical to create new, large and connected protected areas. Therefore alternative approaches are required for improving the long-term persistence of biodiversity through managing threats across tenure boundaries. Most important biodiversity regions in Australia and throughout the world lack a prioritised set of threat management actions to assist decision makers in allocating scarce resources to conserving biodiversity. The few examples that do exist are focused on relatively ecologically intact regions, such as the Kimberley in Western Australia. The purpose of this review is: 1) to identify the major threats to biodiversity in the region arising from multiple past, present and future land uses, including Coal Seam Gas and 2) to identify and prioritise a cost-effective set of management actions to address these threats. The Brigalow Belt region in Queensland is one of the most ecologically transformed areas in Australia. It holds great importance in terms of its biodiversity, with 147 threatened species and 100 communities listed as threatened. The Brigalow Belt region has been subjected to historical broad scale clearing of native vegetation since mid 1800s for different uses: pastoral, agricultural, urbanisation, and more recently mining activities, which are expected to expand in the coming decades. While current conservation efforts in the region are important, they are expected to be insufficient to maintain biodiversity values in the face of these increasing threats. Some useful datasets exist to assist with decision analysis, however a complete set of empirical data for making informed decisions for this region are unavailable. This currently challenges decision-making in the region. New systematic and more efficient and effective approaches to conservation priority setting have been developed in recent years. Decision science has become the basis of novel strategies and frameworks used to prioritise species, locations and more recently, actions in which to invest to improve long term persistence of biodiversity in a region. The approach requires the following basic principles of decision science: (i) a clear objective; (ii) a well-defined set of actions from which a subset will be chosen as priorities; (iii) a model of system behaviour to relate actions to their contributions toward meeting the objectives; (iv) the consideration of resource constraints. Structured Decision-Making - the application of decision science - uses tools such as expert elicitation and cost-effectiveness analyses to collect and evaluate information to advise on the most efficient use of resources. Cost-effectiveness analyses enable comparisons of a range of management actions that will improve the persistence of biodiversity. This requires first knowing the status of biodiversity and its specific threats in an area. Second, identifying the major threats and potential management actions is needed. Third, prioritising those actions based on their cost-effectiveness in mitigating the threats. These can be done using a species or an ecosystem approach or a combination of both, depending on the conservation objective, threats and available resources. This project will provide an analysis of threat management priorities for improving the persistence of biodiversity in the Brigalow Belt region of Queensland. It will involve the collation of the best available scientific information with expert knowledge to identify the most important threats to biodiversity in the region and the actions to abate them. Actions will be parameterised with costs, likely benefits and feasibility estimates, allowing their ecological cost-effectiveness to be ranked. The project will provide, for the first time, a region-wide analysis of alternative actions for managing threats to the Brigalow region biodiversity, which is a critical input for rational and defensible decision-making.",2014,28/2/2018 5:37,22/3/2023 23:46,,42,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,GISERA Project Number 1215,"CSIRO, Australia","Clayton South, Australia",not specified,,Research Report for an External Body - Public Sector,,,GS 2014,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\A597N24W\Ponce-Reyes et al. - 2014 - Priority threat identification, management and app.pdf",,2 - ALA cited

Governments are motivated to use GitHub because it allows them to break down silos of knowledge within government departments and share knowledge more freely. It comes with the challenges to train government workers to use version control systems such as Git, or to work within loose legal frameworks of what software is appropriate for governments to become an open government. As for the usage of the government accounts on the platform, almost 50% of government accounts on GitHub have actively used the platform since 2018. Although there are over 700 government organization accounts on GitHub, there is a lack of metadata or information available on their account as only 47% of them have provided a description about themselves, and only 36% have provided an email address to contact. Additionally, only 3% of all government accounts are verified accounts on GitHub. There is a collaborative relationship between government accounts who use GitHub, however there is a long-tail distribution in the number of collaborations (node degree). Few government accounts such as @alphagov (United Kingdom), @18F (United States of America), or @govau (Australia) are the most frequent collaborators, and they are their respective country's chief open government organizations. Overall, this research demonstrates how to study the progression of open government and open collaboration using GitHub data, users, and organizations as a case study.",2020,1/3/2020 23:28,16/1/2021 4:07,1/3/2020 23:28,,,,,NA,,Analyzing Government Use of GitHub for Collaboration,,NA,NA,,University of Waterloo,"Waterloo, Ontario, Canada",English,,Masters,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\S4JPM62R\Mistry - 2020 - Analyzing Government Use of GitHub for Collaborati.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

3XBL8R8W,report,2020,OGTR,The Biology of Trifolium repens L. (White Clover),,,,,,"This document addresses the biology of Trifolium repens L. (referred to as white clover) with particular reference to the Australian environment, cultivation and use. Information included relates to the taxonomy and origin of white clover, general descriptions of its morphology, reproductive biology, biochemistry, and biotic and abiotic interactions. This document also addresses the potential for white clover to transfer genes via pollen and seed movement and for weediness. It should be noted that due to the large number of white clover cultivars as well as the highly heterozygous nature of white clover populations, which results in many genotypes, it has been necessary to generalise much of the information provided in this document and exceptions may be common. The purpose of this document is to provide baseline information about the parent organism for use in risk assessments of genetically modified (GM) Trifolium repens L. that may be released into the Australian environment. White clover is the most important pasture legume in many temperate parts of the world and in Australia, it is the main legume grown in perennial pastures in cool temperate, summer rainfall zones (Archer and Robinson, 1989). White clover is mostly grown in conjunction with grasses, and is used for grazing, pasture hay and ground cover in horticultural situations, where it supplies a rich source of proteins and minerals to grazing livestock, and fixes large amounts of nitrogen in pastures, thereby improving soil fertility and reducing the need for fertilisers. While white clover is regarded as a perennial plant, it is able to behave as an annual in warm climates or under moisture-stressed conditions. The plant is capable of both asexual (or vegetative) reproduction through the generation of stolons, and sexual reproduction through seed production and dispersal.",2020,17/12/2020 23:37,22/3/2023 23:53,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Department of Health,"Canberra, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\6XUK3NKX\OGTR - 2020 - The Biology of Trifolium repens L.

Human construction activities destroy or damage habitats of nonhuman lifeforms. In many cases, artificial replacement habitats become necessary. However, designing for the needs and preferences of nonhuman lifeforms is challenging. Established workflows for this type of designing do not exist. This paper hypothesises that a multi-scale modelling approach can support inclusive, more-than-human design. The case-study project tests this approach by applying computational modelling to the design of prosthetic habitats for the powerful owl (Ninox strenua). The proposed approach simulates owls' perception of the city based on scientific evidence. The tools include algorithmic mapping, 3D-scanning, generative modelling, digital fabrication and augmented-reality assembly. Outcomes establish techniques for urban-scale planning, site selection, tree-scale fitting, and nest-scale form-making. The findings demonstrate that computational modelling can (1) inform more-than-human design and (2) guide scientific data collection for more inclusive ecosystem management.",2019,2/9/2019 0:19,10/2/2021 6:56,,554-564,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Springer International Publishing,,English,,,,,GS 2019,,10.1007/978-3-030-29829-6_43,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\TDAHSRM2\Roudavski and Parker - 2020 - Modelling Workflows for More-than-Human Design Pr.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map

(blue couch) is a warm-season turfgrass well adapted to use in low maintenance lawns, parks and golf fairways on well-drained acid infertile light-textured soils in humid subtropical and tropical climates with mild winters and an absence of heavy frosting. In Australia, D. didactyla includes material from two different genetic sources: Queensland blue couch from widely naturalised material accidentally introduced from the Mascarene Islands or Madagascar in the early 19th century; and Swazigrass from deliberate introductions of the former D. swazilandensis (native to mainland southern Africa) in the mid-1960s. Two cultivars, 'Aussiblue' and 'Tropika', derived from Swazigrass germplasm have been released in the past 20 years. Blue couch is less drought hardy than Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., but recovers quickly once drought stress is removed. It is tolerant of temporary, though not permanent, waterlogging, but has a low tolerance of salinity. While Queensland blue couch is among the least shade tolerant warm-season turfgrass species, Swazigrass does tolerate moderate levels of shading. Propagation is usually by vegetative means, though limited supplies of Queensland blue couch seed are also available. Blue couch has a low fertility requirement, and can invade and replace C. dactylon under low nutrition on acid infertile soils. It is prone to iron deficiency, especially after heavy rainfall. Blue couch is lower thatching and less prone to scalping than C. dactylon, but is also less tolerant of wear than the latter. Lawn armyworm and sod webworm caterpillars are the main pests, with dollar spot the major disease of concern.

This study aims to find useful DNA barcoding regions for distinguishing these two species and for investigating their population genetic diversity. Levels of polymorphism at six DNA barcoding regions were evaluated in E. vulgare (N = 15) and E. plantagineum (N = 25) sampled in Australia. PCR amplifications were successful in both species at one nuclear region (ITS) and three chloroplast regions (trnH-psbA spacer, trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer).

Seven agents have already been released in Hawaii for this purpose, with six of these becoming established (Nakahara et al. 1992). Liothrips urichi Karny (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) is the first candidate biological control species proposed to undergo testing in Australia. The thrips have been released as a biological control agent for C. hirta in Fiji (1930), the Solomon Islands (1938, 1973 and 1975), Hawaii (1953), Palau (1960 and 1972), and American Samoa (1974) (Conant 2009). Liothrips urichi has established in all but the Solomon Islands and appears to be effective in open, sunny areas (Conant 2009).

LHP454T8,thesis,2020,"Fenker Antunes, J.",Evolution of reptile diversity in tropical savannas - a study across scales and continents,,,,,https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/212364,"What promotes biological diversity? Accurately recognising and describing patterns of diversity is fundamental to understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes underpinning diversification. The history of living organisms is expressed at multiple dimensions, ranging from speciation processes across various biogeographical scales, to variation in morphology, ecology and genetic diversity. Systems with highly heterogeneous habitats provide good models to investigate how landscape processes affect the observed patterns of ecological and genetic diversity, e.g. through speciation and local adaptation. Tropical savannas are environmentally heterogeneous biomes, covering one sixth of the Earth's terrestrial surface, in which a high number of species coexist, with high levels of endemism. My thesis compares pattern and process of savanna reptile diversity across two biogeographic realms - the Cerrado biome from South America and the Australian Monsoonal Tropics (AMT) of Australia. I investigate the principal factors that shape the adaptation and diversification of lizards (and sometimes snakes and amphisbaenians). This entails studies within in each of the Cerrado and AMT systems at landscape to regional scales. Comparing these two analogous but evolutionarily independent systems, I expect to identify common processes underpinning the high diversity of tropical savanna systems. A better understanding of the diversification process has three broad outcomes. First, the use of an integrative approach, including molecular, ecological and morphological datasets, provides a more complete view of the patterns of diversity that we see today. Second, the use of refined population-level and phylogeographic datasets improves our definition of species limits and overcome taxonomic shortfalls that preclude large-scale inferences. Third, the mapping of the distribution of this diversity, and a better understanding of the evolutionary processes involved, is essential to assess conservation priorities give rapid global change. The analyses include morphological, ecological and genomic diversity of squamates from both continents. The thesis is composed of four primary research chapters and two appendices. Each chapter has its own dataset and they collectively address different topics, at varying geographic and taxonomic scales. In chapter 1, I focus on a cross-continent comparison of morphological evolution, including all the snakes and lizards species found in the AMT and Cerrado. Then, focused only on Cerrado lizard species in chapter 2, I mapped spatial patterns of species richness, phylogeographic diversity and endemism to parallel a previous study for the AMT. Coming back to the AMT, I document the phylogeographic structure and demographic history of a diverse and highly structured group of agamid dragons (Diporiphora- Chapter 3). Finally, I explore whether dispersal limitation, environment and geographic barriers or habitat specialization at landscape scale predict differences in phylogeographic structure across co-distributed lizard taxa (Chapter 4). Collectively, these chapters provide new insights into the micro- and macro-evolutionary processes that have shaped the high and unique diversity of reptiles in these tropical savannas.",2020,10/2/2021 5:57,14/3/2023 5:48,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,ANU,"Canberra, ACT, Australia",English,,PhD,,,GS 2021,,10.25911/5f90005fdb5f4,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\SQQ3F8DC\Fenker Antunes - 2020 - Evolution of reptile diversity in tropical savanna.pdf,,2 - ALA cited; ALA author

As planning and allocation of water is most often based on probabilities of historical events reoccurring, the brevity of the instrumental records in Australia represents a crucial issue for the local water industry. However, proxy records from natural archives of climate (e.g. tree rings, corals, ice cores, speleothems and lake sediments) can be used to extend the hydrological record. While tree rings in particular have provided invaluable information at the catchment scale in regions such as North America, dendrochronology has not been widely applied in hydroclimatological analyses in Australia. This is partially due to the perceived lack of long-lived Australian species with annual rings that can be cross-dated. However, recent advances in the field have identified new species that may be suitable for dendrochronology if alternative structural parameters such as wood density, cell diameters and stable isotope analysis are used to identify annual growth and to develop chronologies. This paper aims to highlight the significant potential for expansion of dendroclimatological research and its application in Australia. To achieve this, we present a new around 1000-year summer inflow reconstruction for Lake Burbury in western Tasmania, which exhibits significant centennial scale variability. We then develop a Source model that represents the Lake Burbury hydro-electric water supply system to explore the implications of 'alternate hydrological histories' derived from the inflow reconstruction. Importantly, our findings place recent reduced inflows in a long-term context and demonstrate the potential for sequences of flow, spill rate and storage level recovery outside the observed record. Finally, we map locations with significant potential for new chronologies to be developed. This information could be used as a roadmap for future research and proxy data development.",2018,4/2/2019 4:18,19/2/2021 11:18,,884,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Engineers Australia,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2019,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\H68VBBHZ\Verdon-Kidd et al. - 2018 - The potential for tree ring hydrologic reconstruct.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Following introductory chapters on the fundamentals of life, attention then turns to small molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters and subsequently to macromolecules including proteins and nucleic acids. The interactions between small and macromolecules remains a central point throughout the book. These include enzymatic catalysis, hormone action, neurotransmission, regulation of metabolism, biosynthesis of macromolecules, the mechanism of action of drugs, taste, olfaction, learning and memory, and chemical communication. A second central point of emphasis is the sensitive relationship between chemical structure and biological activity. Examples abound and include why subtle changes in fatty acid architecture have positive or negative outcomes for human health in omega-three fatty acids and trans fats and how modest changes in the chemical decoration of the steroid skeleton provide the difference between male and female sex hormones. Beyond these examples taken from the chemistry of small molecules, the book includes a thoughtful consideration of genomics, including the relationship between genome structure and species. The theme of human health appears throughout the book. Cardiovascular medicine, cancer, metabolic diseases, and diseases of the nervous system receive significant attention including consideration of how a variety of drugs work in combating these issues.

Given the importance, abundance and diversity of pollen, it is vital to exploit assistive technologies like the Classifynder to enable acquisition and analysis of pollen samples. It is also vital that we understand the strengths and limitations of automated systems so that they can be used (and improved) to complement the strengths and limitations of human analysts to the greatest extent possible. This presentation will review some of our initial experiences with the Classifynder system and our exploration of alternative classifier models to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We emphasise that overall classification performance depends on several-sometimes interacting-factors, including the problem domain; the sample of the population of interest; the representation of that sample; and the classifier model(s) employed. Our initial experiments in the pollen analysis problem domain have been based on samples from ANU's pollen reference collection (2890 grains, 15 species) and images bundled with the Classifynder system (400 grains, 4 species). These samples have been represented using the Classifynder feature set. In addition to Classifynder's native neural network classifier, we have evaluated linear discriminant and decision tree classifiers on these data with encouraging results.

It is important to consolidate biodiversity information globally and serve it out to different users depending upon their needs. Global biodiversity data is skewed with data from developed countries in the temperate world constituting most the data and tropical lands with minimal data. For the Indian subcontinent, there are multiple platforms with varied aims, varied functions, and strengths. Data from a variety of biodiversity informatics platforms are aggregated globally. But at the grassroots level, sourcing and curation of the biodiversity information is done by a multitude of biodiversity informatics platforms. Biodiversity Informatics Platforms can be broadly separated into two categories based on the scope of the platform. They are either specific, addressing a single taxonomic group or a single objective. Some of the platforms in this category are the e-bird, the mushroom observer, ifoundbutterflies, etc. These address a single taxonomic group and have been built and use interfaces specific to the group. There are other specific platforms that address a specific target group like the many crowdsourcing and citizen science platforms like the iNaturalist and iSpot. These platforms are vibrant and very successful in sourcing biodiversity data and contributing it to global biodiversity databases. There are other generalist biodiversity platforms like the Atlas of Living Australia, which have diverse information from a variety of taxa and with multiple modules and encompass the whole range of information to understand biodiversity. The India Biodiversity Portal is an attempt to address biodiversity information needs of the Indian sub-continent. Driven by these needs, we have built a platform for crowdsourcing, aggregating and serving biodiversity information. It has an integrated set of modules: an observation module for citizen science; a map module for spatial information; a species pages module, with the goal of having one page for every species; a document module for published information; along with other accessories like a discussion module, and a groups infrastructure. The platform also powers the Bhutan Biodiversity Portal and the WIKWIO (Weed Identification and Knowledge in the Western Indian Ocean) portal. The integrated multi-module architecture enables interactions and sharing information. However, the effort of adding modules and integrating them and the lack of single focus could be a disadvantage. We will discuss the pros and cons of single focus vs multi-focus and multi-module vs a single module approach to biodiversity informatics platforms with examples and experiences.",2015,28/2/2018 5:37,27/2/2023 5:12,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"Nairobi, Kenya",not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QD2BP45Z\TDWG2015_architectureSept2015.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

The country in world terms has a very stable government and is the sixth largest singly-managed land mass. It is one of the least populated and least cultivated and therefore has the greatest land area available for potential other uses (74.9%). By careful selection of plant species and use of saline/sodic borewater and seawater irrigation, a significant area could be set aside to crops in particular, to sustainable fuel crops. Based upon the propagation of halophyte ground crops and trees in arid and semi-arid areas, an estimated 6.5% of the country (500,000km2) is available without encroaching on other land uses. Halophyte species are salt-tolerant or salt-loving. Many grow naturally in Australia and are capable of surviving in desert conditions. They can also be used to progressively reclaim the current 57,000km2 of salt-affected agricultural lands which otherwise will reach 170,000km2 by 2050. Halophyte propagation does not need irrigation but production would increase by using saline/sodic borewater and reticulated seawater. The modelling work described here takes heed of climate, soil type, groundwater availability, coastal proximity, soil salinity and sodicity, dryland salinity risk, urban area salinity risk, protected areas, other land uses and precedents created by Argentina and Abu Dhabi. Current sustainable fuel initiatives are described such as trial propagation of Pongamia and Agave in the northern tropics and of speargrass, bluegrass, brigalow and buffel grass in the Burdekin and Fitzroy River catchment areas. Current production of biofuels, hydroelectricity, solar-voltaic power and wind power is addressed as well as the potential for using safe nuclear power in the future. The author concludes that Australia has the potential to become one of the world's largest producers and exporters of halophyte-based biofuels.",2019,15/3/2020 23:21,16/2/2021 2:21,,1729,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Engineers Australia,"Melbourne, Vic, Australia",English,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\89EDWT86\Thomas - 2019 - The future bioenergy potential of Australia.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Butterflies are commonly seen in nature and hence become a good topic for science education. People observe butterflies and used to identify their species through butterfly illustration handbooks. However, this process is time-consuming and hard for beginners to find the correct answer. Difficulties to identify the butterfly species will reduce people's interests to understand them. In this thesis, we propose a butterfly identification mobile application that combines two complemental sub-systems: an automatic image-based recognition sub-system and a query-and-answer (Q&A) based learning sub-system. We propose an image-based butterfly recognition sub-system to classify 94 kinds of butterflies with dissimilar appearances. The most convenient way to identify butterfly species is to analyze photos of the side views of butterflies. The users select sequentially 3 points on a butterfly image, including end of butterfly hindwing, butterfly compound eye, and end of butterfly forewing. Then our system performs image normalization, image segmentation and feature extraction to obtain the color and texture features. We applied Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine for butterfly classification. The best average precision is 68.51% in the experiments. In this sub-system, introduction of butterflies is re-directed to Wikipedia. When users cannot acquire solutions by the image-based recognition sub-system, users can ask a question by uploading the picture to the butterfly Q&A-based learning sub-system then experts and enthusiasts can answer them. The reliability of the species identification can be done by experts and enthusiasts using a crowdsourcing approach. Moreover, the questioner can become a learner to try to answer questions uploaded by others. The learner can get feedback and earn scores in the community. When learners gain enough scores, they are raised to the Expert-level and have an authority of expert to identify species and help learners.",2015,28/2/2018 5:38,16/2/2021 0:49,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Jinan University,,not specified,,,,,GS 2015,,10.6837/2fNCNU.2015.00232,NA,,,2 - ALA cited; Request Fulltext

Agroforestry is practiced primarily by smallholder farmers in the tropics in subsistence and commercial production. The overall research question for the thesis is - What is the relevance of genetic quality for trees utilised in agroforestry and how are input supply chains taking genetic quality into account? The thesis investigates the relevance of working with smallholder agroforestry input supply chains - in the context of the two opposing views on the role of smallholders versus large farms in the development process and the structural transformation paradigm with a special focus on Africa - and also in the context of the seemingly divergent discourses in agroforestry, the ""Green Revolution strategy"" and ""Agroecological intensification/Complex Livelihoods View"".The thesis discusses adaptation of trees and how to apply adaptation as a quality concept for planting material of trees. The work on provenance research in forestry serves as an indication of the adaptation in the context of current and future climates (climate change). The practical implication for tropical species, almost all of which are untested, is that population-site matching should be the rule rather than just species-site matching. The challenge for population-site matching is that the knowledge on distribution and adaptation for the overwhelming majority of tropical tree species is rudimentary. The thesis therefore proposes to utilise Potential Natural Vegetation Maps (PNVs) as reference vegetation to determine distributions of tropical tree species across environmental variation, using individual PNV types as focal zones (for seed sources) with similar environmental conditions. The thesis tests the concept on a PNV map (co-authored by the present author) of a large forest-savanna area in Kenya and Uganda and finds it to be sufficiently reliable as a tool. The organisational aspects of establishing networks of seed sources are, however, a major but under-appreciated bottleneck for scaling-up and the thesis therefore investigates the functioning of input supply chains and how genetic quality is handled. The focus is on partial sub-sector analyses of Nepal, Malawi, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Kenya and Ethiopia (with the present author as the lead designer of the surveys). The surveys indicate that input supply networks are supply driven with limited concern for sustainability and genetic quality. Almost all seed derive from undescribed seed sources.The hypotheses posed in Chapter 1 (i) that genetic quality as expressed in adaptation is very important and (ii) genetic quality is largely ignored in agroforestry input supply chains, are thus by and large confirmed.

LGBTF9N4,thesis,2017,"Abernathy, Virginia","Investigating the first stages of coevolution between the Pacific koel and its newest host, the red wattlebird",,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1994437659?accountid=26957,"Avian obligate brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species and never provide their own parental care. This behaviour is a model example of coevolution and while multiple studies and reviews have discussed the different types of adaptations and counter-adaptations hosts and brood parasites evolve, there have only been a handful of empirical studies focused on how quickly coevolution can occur in a host-brood parasite system. Additionally, little is known about the early stages of brood parasite and host coevolutionary interactions. Understanding the rates of coevolution between brood parasites and their hosts is an important step in uncovering aspects about the process of speciation, determining which traits represent true genetic change and can aid in conservation decisions of endangered potential hosts, especially as brood parasites expand their breeding ranges with environmental changes.    I investigated these issues by capitalising on the recent exploitation of the Red Wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) by the brood-parasitic Pacific Koel (Eudynamys orientalis). I conducted a literature review on factors that influence the rate of coevolution between avian obligate brood parasites and their hosts and performed observational and experimental studies at two sites where wattlebirds have experienced different durations of parasitism: Sydney (parasitism for 38-86 years) and Canberra (parasitism for 8-33 years). I determined that host switching can pose challenges for both the host and brood parasite, as parasitised wattlebird nests fledged significantly fewer young than unparasitised wattlebird nests, but fledged similar numbers of wattlebird and koel young. The koel's later breeding season relative to the wattlebird's and the koel's poor timing of egg laying may have contributed to the low success of koel eggs. Mobbing experiments demonstrated that naive hosts can learn to recognise a brood parasite within 33 years or less, but the speed at which this defence spreads throughout the population may be constrained by low parasitism rates. Egg rejection experiments indicated that more than 38 years is required for egg ejection to evolve in wattlebirds, as they only ejected model eggs at an extremely low rate in Sydney and Canberra, while two older hosts showed high levels of ejection at both sites. Lastly, I found evidence that the koel likely evolved mimicry of the eggs of one of its old hosts, which allowed it to exploit several other host species, including the wattlebird, due to all of its hosts having similar egg morphology.    My results support the many theoretical models which agree that at least 30 or more years is required for egg ejection alleles to spread throughout a population. This process may be slowed because wattlebird eggs appear so similar to koel eggs, making it more difficult for wattlebirds to recognise parasitic eggs. However, I discovered that naive hosts without specific anti-parasite traits can still utilise generalised defences, such as mobbing, in order to reduce the impact of brood parasitism, and that host switching can also be difficult for the brood parasite, as it may not be well-adapted to the new host's breeding season or behavioural habits.",2017,21/1/2020 3:22,11/2/2021 10:32,,,190,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1994437659,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\RWXX7GQZ\Abernathy - 2017 - Investigating the first stages of coevolution betw.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map

The report builds on a Knowledge Review and Discussion Paper completed in 2018 (Capon et al. 2018), by conducting an analysis of RLP projects funded in the current cycle (2018-2023). Four key outcomes of Commonwealth environmental responsibility are the focus for the proposed LTMF; 1) Ramsar wetlands, 2) threatened species, 3) World Heritage sites and 4) threatened ecological communities. The proposed framework aims to enhance ecological monitoring and evaluation at a RLP project level as well as promoting a culture of robust long-term ecological monitoring and evaluation for Natural Resource Management in Australia more broadly. The objective was to better understand the requirements, opportunities and constraints for long-term ecological monitoring and evaluation within RLP. Based on a review of currently funded projects, the report proposes a suite of standardised ecological monitoring methods that facilitate robust data reporting and analysis for key RLP outcomes through the development of an online platform, nicknamed 'Latimer' (sensu Interpreter). To guide the development of this proposal, we conducted an extensive review of current RLP projects by querying the Department's MERIT (Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement Tool) system*. Information about each of the projects was extracted from MERIT and elements were categorised in a comprehensive database to assess project objectives (i.e. focal RLP outcomes), threats, interventions (i.e. actions taken by RLP service providers), targets, habitats as well as the human dimensions (see Chapter 3). This analysis identified commonalities among projects but also gaps across all four RLP outcomes (i.e. species, habitats, sites that were not captured in the current funding cycle). The analysis of project data provided through MERIT by service providers was supplemented by further consultation with key stakeholders for threatened species as these projects were in the majority of those funded. Additional consultation with service providers also enabled an assessment of acceptance for the proposed LTMF. The proposed LTMF uses two central evaluation pathways underpinned by key evaluation questions associated with each of the RLP program outcomes. The first is a descriptive pathway that articulates how RLP project data can be collected using standardised approaches, collated and captured in an enduring accessible platform that facilitates evaluation and reports across multiple spatial (i.e. projects level, target level, regional level, national level) and temporal scales. The descriptive evaluation pathway links with the implementation of Latimer to provide a modular system that enables evaluation and reporting on monitoring efforts. Protocols for on-ground monitoring draw from existing resource 5 that present standardised methods for data collection (e.g. AusPlots) and are summarised in the report for assessing habitat condition and threatened species (fauna). The second pathway is a mechanistic approach that facilitates the analysis of relationships among project components using a rigorous assessment of hypotheses to gauge the efficacy of any RLP interventions. The success of these interventions can be tested within a series of proposed Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) networks where there is a critical mass of RLP projects that either have a common target species/habitat, where the interventions being applied are consistent among projects, or where projects are monitoring the impacts of specific threats (e.g. fire). Proposed MER networks are presented for two threatened species (Regent Honeyeater and Australasian Bittern), for projects undertaking revegetation with a focus on weed control as intervention as well as those addressing the current and future threat by fires and how these systems respond to such disturbance. The proposed MER network approach provides a flexible means to enable the RLP program to provide adaptive responses to monitoring requirements (e.g. in response to gaps and/or disturbance events). The implementation of the LTMF is linked to the development of a novel online platform, Latimer, that serves to coordinate data collection, analysis, evaluation and reporting. Latimer is a virtual laboratory that draws together RLP project data in a central repository where end-users can interrogate these data and supplementary secondary/spatial data (e.g. climate data, landcover, fire overlays etc.) using a series of analytical tools (modules). These modules allow end-users to design bespoke evaluation and reporting systems that can address the key evaluation questions at the project, program or national level depending on requirements. As Latimer is populated with standardised RLP data there will be increasing opportunity to use these data as baseline/benchmark measures to evaluate temporal variation in the status or condition of species and/or their habitats.",2020,17/12/2020 23:55,14/3/2023 23:15,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment","Queensland, Australia",not specified,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\CMHL4J8E\Capon et al. - 2020 - A long-term monitoring framework for the Regional .pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map

DEQW3HFX,thesis,2020,"Milner, K.",The price of heat stress: functional and resource constraints to thermal tolerance in arid zone plants,,,,,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/142273,"Understanding how plants cope with extreme temperatures is key to determining species distribution under climate change. Plants possess an inherent ability to withstand high temperatures and acquire greater thermal tolerance seasonally. The membranes and photosynthetic apparatus in leaves are particularly susceptible to heat damage and likely to respond to different environmental cues. The question arises as to how these two systems differ in acquiring thermal tolerance and what roles proteins have in raising thresholds. As part of the stress response and to aid in thermal tolerance, heat shock proteins (HSP) are upregulated, but there are associated resource costs, of particular concern for natural populations. In extreme environments, like deserts, the additional stressors of water and nutrient limitation may affect how plants allocate resources to growth, reproduction and survival. My thesis is important in linking ecology, plant physiology and molecular biology over seasonal time scales in wild Australian desert plant species 𝘪𝘯 𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘶 in desert conditions. I estimated temperature thresholds of photosystem II (PSII, using chlorophyll a fluorescence) membrane stability (via electrolyte leakage) and fitness (via reproductive output) in response to heat stress across seasons. To determine how relative protein expression changes with conditions, I also quantified the complete proteome using shotgun proteomics with tandem mass spectrometry. Overall, species acquired higher thresholds of PSII and membranes and HSP expression was dependent upon season, with little sHSP detected in winter. Cost of three-hour heat stress was reduced in plants with access to additional nutrients, but unexpectedly, heat stress in spring was found to be less costly than in summer, likely due to more severe summer conditions making recovery hard. I show that changes to the proteome are complex, but consistent patterns emerged, with lipid metabolism, ROS homeostasis and HSPs meeting expectations of higher expression during summer. Also, regardless of species or heat-stress treatment, small HSPs were detected in greatest amounts in summer, emphasising the importance of small-HSPs for acquired thermal tolerance in desert species. Importantly, species differences were highlighted throughout the research. Across broad climatic zones, species have many modes for achieving the same outcome and microhabitat likely has an effect on driving adaptation. My work underscores the temporal dynamics of plant thermal tolerance in non-crop species in the environment and how this is achieved through proteome changes. However, my findings suggest that for species from harsh microhabitats, increasing heat stress in summer may have particularly severe consequences.",2020,9/9/2020 5:32,11/2/2021 8:30,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,,not specified,,Bachelor of Science,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3U5ZPJUQ\Milner - 2020 - The price of heat stress functional and resource .pdf,,2 - ALA cited

All  Ceratina show a degree of mutual tolerance for nestmates as they nest together in pre-dispersal assemblages and display extended maternal care. Many Ceratina also nest facultatively with multiple females per nest. Males usually disperse before the beginning of the reproductive season. Ceratina have emerged as model organisms to study the evolution of social behavior within the Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps). As hymenopteran sex is determined by the haplodiploid sex determination system wherein males are haploid and females are diploid, the result is a relatedness asymmetry between brothers and sisters, whereby sisters share a greater proportion of similar genes compared to brothers. Kin selection theory predicts that daughters are more likely to help rear sisters compared to brothers and is used to explain the prevalence of social behavior within the Hymenoptera.    Here the relatedness between populations and within nests of the Australian small carpenter bee Ceratina (neoceratina) australensis is examined with the use 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci. In chapter 1, the eight microsatellite loci are described and applied to three known populations of Ceratina australensis within Australia. Chapter 1 provides evidence for migration from north to south following the river systems of the Murray-Darling River Basin (MRDB). The MRDB has undergone substantial anthropogenic alterations to the natural vegetation communities since European settlement. Chapter 1 provides evidence for the hypothesis that C. australensis expansion into Australia has been aided by the introduction of pithy stemmed plants and establishes how patterns of dispersal can affect the social biology of this species. Chapter 2 deals directly with understanding the presence of male bees within nests of C. australensis that were found predominately, but not exclusively, within the most genetically homogenous population from chapter 1. The existence of inbreeding was not confirmed by visual inspection of genotypes or relatedness estimates between male adults and female offspring. Nests with males had lower brood survivorship compared to solitary nests but reproductive females in nests with males did not have significantly lower fitness compared to reproductive females in other nest types. The inclusive fitness of non-reproductive females was significantly lower than the fitness of reproductive females and the inclusive fitness of males was zero.

MH9GWWKC,thesis,2019,"Platell, Ghislaine Anne Marie Marguerite","Exploring intraspecific variation in the gut communities of Western Australian endemic termites (lsoptera, Termitidae) as a foundation for future local biofuel initiatives",,,,,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/exploring-intraspecific-variation-in-the-gut-communities-of-weste,"Climate change is arguably the biggest issue facing humanity today. Mitigation strategies can reduce humankind's net greenhouse gas contributions and in turn reduce our impact on further climate change. In particular, second generation biofuel technologies produced from crop and forest residues, have the benefits of decreased greenhouse gas emissions and low competition with food needs, as well as the potential to reduce waste streams and improve agricultural land quality. In Western Australia, the two most promising substrates are wheat straw and eucalyptus mallee. Biofuels from wheat straw would recycle crop ""waste"" that is currently being burnt, hence providing improvements to two human activities that contribute to climate change. The biggest barrier to the implementation of biofuel production from these substrates is the development of a cost-effective cellulose hydrolysis process. Higher termites (Isoptera, Termitidae) are a promising source of enzymes because they harbour primarily bacterial consortia that efficiently degrade various forms of lignocellulose, optimised over evolutionary time. In this thesis, I have investigated short-term influences on the termite gut community to determine whether members of the gut population of endemic higher termites may warrant further study as part of optimised biofuel production from wheat crop residue in Western Australia. To my knowledge, I provide the first characterisation of gut communities of three endemic Western Australian termites with broad diets, higher termites Tumulitermes westraliensis, Amitermes obeuntis and the lower termite Coptotermes acinaciformis raffrayi. I propose new standards for experimental design in the study of termite gut communities, including the use of a standardised 16S rRNA amplification strategy, increased replication, a standard species core community definition and analysis method for accurate core community calculations. My work evaluates potential factors shaping intraspecific variation in the gut community of higher termites, providing a greater understanding of the vertically, horizontally and environmentally acquired components of the bacterial and protistan microbiota and the generation of intraspecific variation. Protein extraction and visualisation protocols were optimised with the aim to improve the integrity of enzymes recovered from termite guts and enhance binding of cellulase-specific probes, with a future aim to isolate them for further testing. My project confirms that diet affects termite gut core community composition and abundance on a short time scale under field conditions. Intraspecific variation occurring on a short time scale allows the manipulation of the gut community to target substrates of interest, laying the foundation for future local biofuel initiatives. Potential future studies are outlined and could focus on the gut communities or enzymes produced by higher termites feeding directly on biofuel substrates of interest, such as wheat and/or eucalyptus mallee in Western Australian Wheatbelt fields.",2019,20/5/2019 5:52,14/3/2023 23:25,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Western Australia,"Perth, WA, Australia",not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2019,,10.26182/5ca6abb57fdca,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\LAR647WN\Platell - 2019 - Exploring intraspecific variation in the gut commu.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Spatial Portal

The expansion of eucalypt crops to regions with lower temperatures is a strategy some countries, including Brazil, have used to increase production. Consequently, great efforts have been made to select genotypes, either species or varieties, intended for breeding in order to maximize survival and improve growth rates and productivity, combined with cold tolerance. Part of this study aimed at comparing the photochemical response of 20 species of eucalypts subjected to low temperature in order to classify them in more or less sensitive to cold, so that some could be selected for further investigation regarding their biochemical and molecular responses. After 2 h of exposure to low temperature, the species were grouped into sensitive or tolerant based on their photochemical response. However, despite the grouping of the species, they did not present a well-defined metabolic profile of response; therefore it is not possible to map the initial response strategy to cold in these species. Analyses were made for compounds considered responsive to low temperatures and expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. The transcription factors CBF1-CBF16 (C-repeat binding factor) annotated on the Eucalyptus grandis genome had the gene expression analyzed. Except for CBF16, all others CBFs showed induction of cold response at 5°C in all species. However, the variation in intensity of induction suggests a modulation in the CBF pathway for the regulation of cold tolerance among the species of Eucalyptus, as seen for CBF12, which was highly induced in E. urophylla and in the hybrid E. grandis x E. urophylla, but with low expression in E. globulus. Furthermore, CBF genes have great potential for use in breeding eucalyptus for different purposes, since many of them are responsive to more than one type of abiotic stress such as salt, osmotic and/or the heavy metal copper, such as the genes CBF8, CBF12 and CBF13 from E. grandis. The study of the cis-regulatory element (CRE) in the promoter region of genes reinforce the variation in their regulation, even those that are highly conserved products of duplication (CBFa-like and CBFb-like groups). Therefore, our results can be used to guide new experiments aiming to elucidate the role of CBF genes in Eucalyptus as well as those aimed at searching for species/genotypes more adapted to low temperature conditions for cultivation in Brazil",2016,28/2/2018 6:09,11/2/2021 8:23,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Universidad Estadual de Campinas, Brazil",,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\RGQ9IHCL\Schimpl_FlaviaCamila_D.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Few of these introductions are genuinely invasive species, and an even smaller proportion is documented as having a negative impact on their local ecosystem. However, those negative impacts that do occur are far ranging and difficult to manage, because of the distances and remoteness of the area, a lack of economic incentives for control, and contention regarding the economic, environmental and social benefits and costs of some species. Management of the weeds of arid regions must involve all aspects of the biosecurity continuum, including quarantine and containment. Depending on the size of invaded areas and the particular species, options can include mechanical control, herbicide applications, fire and grazing in various combinations and biological control. Management will need to respond to changes in climate with research required into adaptive responses.",2018,30/8/2018 5:24,11/2/2021 11:32,,307-330,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Springer International Publishing,,English,,,,,GS 2018,,10.1007/978-3-319-93943-8_12,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\M3TIIUSW\Scott et al. - 2018 - Weeds in Australian Arid Regions.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map

BSS2LG2W,thesis,2016,"Thomas, Ian",An assessment of the feasibility of using vegetable oil fuels in light of the impending post fossil fuel dilemma,,,,,https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/discovery/fulldisplay/alma9921863906101341/61RMIT_INST:ResearchRepository,"This work reviews the use of compression ignition engines fuelled by a range of vegetable oil fuels, conducts a 45,000 km on-road trial using a 50/50 blend of waste vegetable oil and diesel fuel, reviews available plant species, availability of land for growing fuel crops and conducts a detailed study of Australia's prospects for growing fuel crops. It finds that diluted vegetable oil is a viable fuel in conventional diesel engines, that there are some 2500 non-food oil-producing ground-crop and tree species available, and that there is nowhere near enough land in the world to feed the growing human population and to provide fuel when fossil-fuels run out. The most promising class of plant species is shown to be halophytes in particular, those which grow in arid and semi-arid areas. <br /><br />The literature review and on-road trials were conducted simultaneously. The review studied 65 publications covering the period 1980-2014 on the use of vegetable oil fuels in automotive and some other compression ignition engines either as straight oils or as blends. Exhaust emission and engine performance findings are tabulated and assessed. Vegetable oil fuel is found from the literature review, to be viable provided that measures are taken to reduce viscosity such as dilution or dual-fuelling and provided that greater ignition-advance is incorporated to allow longer burning time.<br /><br />The on-road trial used mostly 50/50 decanted and sieved waste vegetable oil and diesel fuel with and without homogenising additives in a 1996 IDI diesel engine powered utility vehicle. Difficulties were experienced but they were able to be addressed. Some statistically significant improvements in fuel consumption are reported when performing repeatable, long country runs. While the work demonstrated that this pre-Euro 2 low-pressure mechanically injected vehicle could be operated on the 50/50 blend, this may not necessarily be the case for modern high-pressure, common-rail engines. Upon completion, trial findings were compared with findings by others. <br /><br />The oil-producing species appraisal lists 341 non-food species and 73 food-related species describing a selection of 26 of these in more detail. It is evident that availability of species will not limit use of biofuels and that there should be no need to deplete food oils or fertile food-producing land in order to provide for our fuel needs. Rather with care, the broad range of salt-tolerant saltwater irrigated species such as sea asparagus, sea rocket and sea radish are considered capable of development in coastal margins in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner. Many other, arid area growing species show promise but only if care is taken to avoid the often associated adverse sociological and environmental impacts. The author&nbsp; delves more deeply into the potential for halophyte species to provide both fuel and food by being grown in coastal margins, arid areas, deserts and salt-affected farmlands. It quickly becomes clear that the 400 Mha of world farmland nominally available for biofuel production is insufficient against the present need for at least 2500 Mha for producing fuel.<br /><br />The current alternative fuel situation in Australia is presented as well as the potential to produce vegetable oil and other biofuels. Available native species, where they grow and how and where they may be cropped for fuel production are addressed. A detailed biogeographical appraisal of Australia estimates that 500,000 km2 are available provided that for each selected location, the correct species is chosen and due consideration is given to existing peoples and land uses. <br /><br />The author concludes that vegetable oils and indeed biofuels as a whole, can presently only be part of the solution to the impending world energy crisis. The full solution is therefore likely to be a combination of vegetable oil and other biofuels together with other sustainable/renewable energy forms such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal, hydroelectric, wind, wave, tidal and salinity-gradient power. At the same time, as much waste vegetable oil and new non-food oils should be used as is physically, morally and environmentally practicable.",2016,25/2/2021 4:37,25/2/2021 4:41,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,RMIT,"Melbourne, Vic, Australia",English,,PhD,,,Airtable,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\IUSR98DA\Thomas - 2016 - An assessment of the feasibility of using vegetabl.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

C6ZV2CZP,report,2013,"James, C.; VanDerWal, J.; Capon, S.; Hodgson, L.; Waltham, N.; Ward, D.; Anderson, B.; Pearson, R.",Identifying climate refuges for freshwater biodiversity across Australia,,,,,https://www.nccarf.edu.au/publications/identifying-climate-refuges-freshwater-biodiversity,"Severe climatic changes are predicted for Australia before the close of this century. Climate change threatens biodiversity in all ecosystems; a management and conservation priority is to identify areas and habitats - refuges - that could shelter species from the worst impacts. Freshwater ecosystems contain high biodiversity, but are especially vulnerable to climatic changes due to their limited extent and connectivity. In much of Australia, they are highly susceptible to drying resulting from high variability in temperatures and rainfall. Identifying, protecting and managing refuges in freshwater systems must therefore be a key component of future conservation planning and policy. Using a variety of approaches, we explore the history and definitions of refuges in freshwater systems, assess the relatively stability and general refugial value of large-scale regions across the Australian continent and provide three case studies demonstrating applications of the continental analysis to inform more local adaptation strategies. A review of existing concepts of refuges for biodiversity highlights a number of issues that contribute to confusion and imprecision surrounding their definition, and we offer a new, simplified concept of refuges with respect to climate change in freshwater systems. Projected climate changes are highly spatially and seasonally variable, and this project has identified freshwater regions which will remain stable in the future, and those which will likely not. Many regions will likely experience climates and events well outside their current range of variability, and we predict significant changes in community structure and ecosystem assemblages. In these areas of instability, we propose that refuges will be of high priority, for example areas where temperature changes are buffered by vegetation or topographic shading. We show that some current protected areas will fail to offer refuge and protection under projected climatic changes.

In the aftermath, a continent-wide prioritisation was undertaken to identify which of Australia's 26,062 plant taxa may be most at risk of impacts and extinction. This prioritisation was based on a set of 11 criteria (A-K) developed in consultation with experts in plant and fire ecology, led by Dr Tony Auld of the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, and endorsed by the Wildlife and Threatened Species Bushfire Recovery Expert Panel. This Final Assessment refines and extends the methods applied in the Interim Assessment Report ver. 1.4 (Gallagher 2020) by including an additional 7,058 plant taxa, new data on species traits, and revised spatial analysis for several criteria. As previously, 1,335 plant taxa listed as threatened under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and 4,622 listed under state legislation have been assessed. Burnt area statistics are shown in Table ES1; 8% of EPBC Act taxa had more than 50% of their range burned during the 2019-2020 fire season. Of the 26,062 plant taxa assessed, 486 were prioritised as requiring immediate action to assess impacts and support recovery. These taxa had more than 80% of their range burnt, or were listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered under the EPBC Act or state/territory listings, or were listed as HIGH risk under two or more of the criteria assessed. Of these 486 high priority species, 369 appeared in the Interim Assessment, and 117 and 102 have been gained and lost, respectively. These changes in species identified as high priority are due to the inclusion of more taxa, new trait data and refined threat information relative to the Interim Assessment.",2020,27/10/2020 3:39,21/3/2023 23:27,,62,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment",Australia,English,,,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\KXAMK4EJ\Rv - Final National prioritisation of Australian plants.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; ALA API

Recent findings of two Critically Endangered sea snake species (Aipysurus apraefrontalis and Aipysurus foliosquama) in locations outside of their previously defined ranges have highlighted the lack of information on species distributions along the North West coast of Australia. Data on sea snake sightings on previously collected baited remote underwater video surveys (BRUVS) and fisheries independent trawl surveys were used to assess the utility of these methodologies to accurately define relative abundance and distribution patterns of sea snakes in the North West Marine Region (NWMR), including within Commonwealth Marine Reserves (CMRs), to refine species' status. Presence/absence data from BRUVS were used to predict locations that are likely important habitats for sea snake populations within the NWMR, which included mid-shelf and oceanic shoals along the Kimberley and Pilbara coasts. Limited fisheries-independent trawl sampling data collected in Shark Bay and Exmouth Gulf highlighted patterns of interaction between sea snakes and trawl fishing, with survivorship curves indicating that most sea snake species encountered within these regions may be able to sustain low to moderate levels of trawl fishing. Trawl survey data also highlighted the need for additional fisheries interaction data to accurately assess the species-specific influence of fishing activities (e.g. trawl and trap fishing) on different life stages of sea snakes susceptible to incidental capture (bycatch). This project highlights the need for more data on sea snakes in regions lacking information (e.g. mid-shelf shoals of Kimberley coast, Pilbara coast and Rowley Shoals). In addition, further research is also required to assess the degree of connectivity between sea snake populations from offshore reefs that have seen recent declines, and those on adjacent mid-shelf and oceanic shoals.",2016,28/2/2018 6:09,21/3/2023 23:48,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,nespmarine.edu.au,Australia,not specified,,,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\WRDDNTJA\Udyawer et al. - 2016 - Exploring the status of Western Australia's sea sn.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Although declines in photosynthetic rates during limited water supply partly reflect a drop in stomatal conductance, there is another, often overlooked cause: the tendency for intracellular photosynthetic capacity to shut down at low leaf water potentials. This tendency, which we term mesophyll photosynthetic sensitivity (MPS), was likely an important constraint on the evolution of land plants and shaped several key traits affecting photosynthesis and stomatal behavior. However, almost nothing is known about how MPS varies across ecologically divergent plants. To explore this fundamental constraint on plant growth and competitive ability, I investigated under lab and field conditions how MPS differs in terrestrial plant species that vary drastically in native climatic conditions, ecophysiological behavior, and drought tolerance strategies, and asked how such sensitivity is related to peak photosynthetic rates, stomatal behavior, leaf anatomical traits related to gas exchange and hydraulic transport, and annual rainfall vs. pan evaporation in their native habitats. Studying ten dominant Eucalyptus species (five each from Eucalyptus subg. Symphyomyrtus and subg. Monocalyptus) and carefully accounting for phylogenetic relationships, I (1) compared MPS of these species grown in greenhouse conditions to the ratio of precipitation to pan evaporation of their natural distributions in Australia, and to their peak photosyn¬thetic rate and water potential at leaf wilting; (2) placed these species along the continuum of stomatal behavior continuum of isohydry to anisohydry, and determined how placement along this continuum relates to MPS and key gas-exchange and hydraulic parameters. Finally (3), using five arboreal species of the Western United States that range across the iso- to anisohydric continuum, I investigated how dehydration tolerant vs. dehydration avoidant drought strategies, characterized by several stomatal and hydraulic traits, relate to MPS, and determined what role osmolytic sugars have on leaf water potential and MPS. This dissertation displays that MPS is tightly linked to habitat moisture availability and plant hydraulic behavior, suggesting possible use as a new drought tolerant trait in terrestrial plants.",2020,13/10/2020 0:50,29/6/2021 6:10,,,147,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The University of Wisconsin - Madison,United States -- Wisconsin,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MBJHKEAC\Salvi - 2020 - Mesophyll Photosynthetic Sensitivity to Leaf Water.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Modelling; Climate Data
VX9FDKUB,thesis,2014,"Miller, Eliot T.",Evolution and ecology of two iconic Australian clades: The Meliphagidae (birds) and the Hakeinae (plants),,,,,https://irl.umsl.edu/dissertation/200,"The first part of this dissertation explores the evolution of two iconic groups of species through Australian climate space: the Meliphagidae, or honeyeaters, which are primarily nectar-feeding birds, and the Hakeinae, a section of the plant family Proteaceae. Both groups are inferred to have had their origins in Gondwanan rainforests that were widespread across Australia 45 million years ago and then diversified into more arid environments as the continent's climate became more arid. Accordingly, dry environments are inhabited by closely related (phylogenetically clustered) sets of species, although, in contrast to the honeyeaters, Hakeinae communities are characterized by more localized diversification. The impressive and rapid Hakeinae diversification may have been driven by specialization onto a variety of highly weathered, nutrient-poor soil types on the ancient Australian landmass.    The second part of this dissertation reviews a variety of methods to assess the phylogenetic structure of communities, such as local assemblages of honeyeaters and Hakeinae. Many published methods were found to be redundant, and some of the truly unique approaches do not measure what they purport to. Accordingly, only a small subset of phylogenetic community structure methods have merit.    In the third part of the dissertation, observations on foraging by 74 of 75 Australian honeyeater species are used to explore patterns of community assembly. Australian honeyeater communities reflect both stochastic and deterministic processes. Co-occurring species exhibit substantial overlap in foraging niche space, in contrast to predictions from assembly theory based on competition. At the same time, species tend to occupy characteristic portions of niche space and available niche space is smaller in the arid regions of the continent. Within this smaller available niche space, arid-zone species tend to be more widely separated in niche space than species in more mesic environments.",2014,21/1/2020 3:22,29/6/2021 6:10,,,302,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Missouri - Saint Louis,Ann Arbor,English,,PhD,,1650629301,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\92GJZFGW\Miller - 2014 - Evolution and ecology of two iconic Australian cla.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Species distribution modelling is a GIS application that has been used in a number of different studies. In this instance it will be used to predict and map the habitat suitability of areas across the Condamine River catchment in Queensland for the subject species and thus provide information valuable for developing conservation strategies. The maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling software program was utilised in species distribution modelling. The data for the project has been sourced from a variety of spatial data custodians and then processed through the ArcGIS software to achieve the required data format for analysis. Two main types of datasets were required: the samples (sightings) data of the species, and the environmental variables that provide information to derive the prediction. These variables include; land use, DEM, slope, aspect, regional ecosystems, roads and drainage data. The modelling has produced a satisfactory and valuable set of results. The main output is a species distribution map, in which every area is assigned specific habitat suitability values for the cockatoo in the area. Another important result is the contribution made by each variable to the final model. In this project land use (46.2%) and elevation (34.9%) were the most important variables in the model, while aspect (1.3%) was the most inconsequential. Conducting this research has opened up avenues for further work such as expanding the scope to alternate species or different areas. Doing so would further assist in preventing the demise of an endangered species. Doing further research into the specific characteristics of the identified areas of high suitability would also be enlightening. The project has been successful in indentifying suitable habitat for the Glossy Black Cockatoo.

We exclude impacts at the mine sites and focus only on the infrastructure. For each development scenario we report the overlap of areas proposed for development with areas of high conservation priority, expected losses of biodiversity (average proportion of feature distributions within the USG Region that are lost due to development) and maximum impacts on biodiversity (which biodiversity features will be most affected).

This large, Neotropical toad has been introduced and become invasive in over 40 countries in tropical and subtropical ecosystems around the world. The largest and arguably most damaging invasion site is in Australia. Originally introduced in 1935 as a biocontrol agent to control sugar cane beetle pests, the toad has since expanded its Australian range across nearly 20% of the continent's landmass. It is still expanding its range in northwest Australia, while range edges in eastern and southern Australia are relatively stable. Species invasions, although unfortunate, provide unique opportunities to study the evolutionary and ecological causes for species' geographic range limits. This field has had an abundance of theoretical development over the last few decades, but fewer empirical studies. Understanding species' range limits in natural systems has become an urgent priority because global warming, exotic species invasions, and habitat alteration are currently changing the distributions of many species around the world. We used the cane toad invasion of Australia as a model system to study the ecological and evolutionary causes for species' geographic range limits in a landscape genomics framework. Using next generation sequencing we developed approximately 28,000 genomic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for population and landscape genomic analyses. We first investigated general patterns of genomic diversity and differentiation across the cane toad's Australian range in the context of species' range limits. We found that the 'central marginal hypothesis' for species' range limits is supported. We then used genetic differentiation outliers and genotype environment association analyses to detect genomic regions under selection. We found strong evidence for rapid evolution at the expanding invasion front, at even higher levels than stable range edges in eastern and southern Australia. Finally, we performed a common garden laboratory experiment and found phenotypic evidence of local adaptation to breeding pond temperatures at an arid inland edge, but not at a cold southern edge, of the cane toad's Australian range.",2015,28/2/2018 6:08,29/6/2021 6:10,,,172,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Washington State University,Ann Arbor,English,,PhD,,1775741101,ProQuest,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MQ9U3PTZ\Trumbo - 2015 - Landscape genomics and species range limit evoluti.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

K.",Value of information for conservation and natural resource management,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/11343/192510,"The value of information (VOI) is a set of decision theoretic tools that were formulated over half a century ago. More recently, VOI analysis has been applied to decision problems for conservation and natural resource management. In this thesis I explore the use of VOI for the conservation sciences to date, extend its application to new subfields and problem types, and address gaps in the understanding of its implementation and implications for conservation decision makers. I begin this thesis with a review of VOI analysis for conservation and natural resource management. I found that there are two branches of VOI in the literature. The first consists of informal VOI analyses, commonly applied to spatial conservation planning problems. The second branch employs VOI in the formal sense. Formal VOI has tended to be used for problems involving the management of plant and animal populations. I conjecture that differences in how the two branches apply their analyses have led to formal VOI reporting low value of information, while informal methods often report larger value. I then undertake three new case studies using VOI analyses for conservation decision problems. In the first, I apply VOI to the management of Box-Ironbark forest and woodland management. Here I demonstrate how VOI can be calculated when a system model is large, complicated and involves many model parameters. I use modern statistical tools such as multivariate adaptive regression splines, and Monte Carlo simulation to make the problem more tractable. In the second case-study I extend the use of VOI to the field of spatial conservation planning, a field previously the domain of informal VOI analysis. Here I show how bootstrapped habitat maps can be used to summarize the inherent uncertainty in a spatial conservation plan and how spatial conservation planning software such as Zonation, in conjunction with statitistical boostrapping, can be used to calculate the value of reducing that uncertainty for the decision maker/reserve designer. In my last case-study I explore the use of expected value of sample information (EVSI) to optimize learning about bids in a conservation auction. In doing so, I propose a set of guiding principles that an agency conducting a conservation auction can apply before they decide to invest in conservation actions. The principles will allow a better allocation of resources for learning about bid cost-efficiency. Before concluding my thesis I tackle a subject so far avoided in the conservation and natural resources management literature; the interaction of risk-tolerance and value of information. Here I demonstrate, with the aid of a toy example, that ignoring the role of risk-tolerance in decision making can mislead an analyst who is calculating the value of information. This work has extended the number and types of problems for which VOI analyses have been applied for conservation problems and outlines a number of new techniques that may be of use to decision-makers.",2017,28/2/2018 6:06,29/6/2021 6:10,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Melbourne,,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2017,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\NGJXF4SL\MorrisPhDSeptember2017.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Those who become able to expand their populations in the new areas are known as invasive and are often involved in undesirable effects in indigenous populations, communities and ecosystems. The axis deer was introduced worldwide for hunting. Despite its wide distribution and use, little is known about its effects on the invaded areas and regions in which this species can become invasive. This complicates the decision-making because assessing the effects of the introduction and predict areas at risk of invasion are key tasks for prevention strategies, prioritization and control actions. Like this. So, this study aimed to summarize the effects of the axis deer in invaded areas using a systematic review protocol and to model the potential distribution of this species globally and in South America using bioclimatic variables. To summarized the effects we conducted searches for studies on non-native areas in three databases, using three sets of key-words and classified the studies that met the criteria of the protocol according to the level of inference about the effects they investigated. We extracted the types mentioned effects and occurrence region. To model the potential distribution based on bioclimatic variables we used the program Maxent. We used occurrences from the original distribution and three regions where the species is invasive about which geographical coordinates could be obtained or estimated. Four studies demonstrated effects of the axis deer due to competition with native species, changes in the floristic and faunistic composition and facilitation of other invasion processes. Six studies speculated the occurrence of disease transmition, hybridization with other species and difuse degradation of forest areas in combination with other invasive species. The distribution model demonstrated that large extensions of South America, Central Africa and Southeast Asia are susceptible to invasion. In the southern cone of South America Brazil, Uruguay, northern Argentina and Paraguay include extensive areas prone to invasion based on the bioclamatic models.",2016-06,28/2/2018 6:09,16/3/2022 1:35,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil",Porto Alegre,Portugese,,Master,,,GS 2016,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\YMCVPBXK\001005333.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records
NUKA5YHJ,thesis,2015,"Bernays, S.","Chasing the Dragon: The Resilience of a Species to Climate Change in the Wet Tropics, Australia",,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/10072/367595,"Throughout history, climatic changes have caused environmental systems to shift and have influenced biotic assemblages. Most of these changes have occurred slowly, over millions of years, enabling species to either adapt to new conditions, endure the changes, or shift distributions to maintain their habitat requirements. Due to the fast rate at which climate change is currently occurring, it is unknown if species will be able to use these mechanisms to successfully respond to this rapidly changing environment. Areas that have small geographical extents, elevated uplands and high numbers of endemic species, such as the Wet Tropics in north-eastern Queensland, are expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. The endemic species in this at-risk area are also expected to be more susceptible to climate change. The endemic Boyd's forest dragon (Hypsilurus boydii, Macleay) is a highly camouflaged, large lizard that inhabits lowland and upland forests from the northern to the southern boundary of the Wet Tropics. Determining how H. boydii has responded to previous climate change may give insight into how the species may respond to future climatic changes. The main aims of this study were to understand how geographical features and climate have influenced the genetic makeup, morphology and distribution of H. boydii, and to use this information to determine how climate change may influence future populations. This study used genetic analyses to identify evolutionary and geographical relationships across the Wet Tropics (north vs. south of the Black Mountain corridor [BMC] and upland vs. lowland) and within each of these regions; explore morphological variation across the regions and examine conformity to three eco-geographical rules (Bergmann's rule, Allen's rule, and the isolation rule); and attempt to predict species distribution patterns of the species throughout the Wet Tropics during past, present and future climatic scenarios. Seventy-seven dragons were collected from nine sites across the Wet Tropics, with a blood sample (for genetic analyses) taken from each individual, 47 of these individuals, from eight of the sites, were sampled for morphological measurements. Due to the cryptic and ambush nature of the species, sample sizes were low and uneven.",2015,28/2/2018 6:02,14/3/2023 5:35,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Griffith University,,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2015,,https://doi.org/10.25904/1912/126,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\7RHTLEJM\Bernays_2015_02Thesis.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Sedimentary records often show shifts in average chain-lengths (ACL) of n-alkanes, both across geologic time and modern-day climate gradients and this shift may be climate driven.     Australia spans a broad range of different climate conditions providing an ideal study area for investigating the relationship of ACL to climate. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) has developed a network of biodiversity monitoring plots (AusPlots and TREND) at which plant and soil samples are collected and made available to the research community. By analysing n-alkane ACL present in plants and soils collected from these sites and comparing with each site's respective climatic conditions, this study examines whether ACL of leaf wax n-alkanes varies systematically in modern plants and soils in relation to climate over a N-S transect of Australia.    Specifically, this study examines whether:  (1) ACL in plants correlates with different climate variables.   (2) ACL measured in soil represents a weighted average of the ACL of the dominant plant species at each site.   (3) ACL signature in the soils correlates to different climate variables.    This study finds no relationship between the different climate variables to ACL of modern plants. Further, the weighted average of the dominant plant species ACL from each site analysed is a poor predictor of the actual ACL present in the soils. In contrast to ACL from plants, the ACL from the soils shows a strong relationship with temperature and aridity measures. Soils may correlate better with climate because they integrate a long-term average of highly variable ACL values from all contributing organisms.

However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the influence of environmental variables on shrub distributions, and shrubland remains undefined as a plant functional type in most global vegetation models. Broadly, the goal of my thesis was to assess relationships between the distribution of Australian shrubland and shrub species and environmental properties, specifically climate and soil characteristics. The objectives of my thesis were three-fold. I initially assessed how the climate envelope of shrubland differed from other major vegetation types (forest, woodland, grassland) as well as differences between the six major shrubland classes (Acacia, Chenopod, Heathland, Mallee, Tall shrublands, ""other"" shrublands). Using generalized linear models I found that shrublands separate from other major vegetation types along a seasonal soil moisture gradient, with shrublands being the dominant vegetation type in areas with lower moisture. I then used MaxEnt, a species distribution model, to assess drivers of thedistributions of 29 shrub species that together represented dominant members of each of the six shrubland classes. In particular, I sought to determine whether the inclusion of soil characteristics, along with climate variables, improved models of species distributions. I found that whilst models calibrated with soil and climate were not significantly more powerful than those calibrated with only climate variables, for some species projections of the distribution of suitable habitat differed substantially across these models. This led to regional differences in projected species richness, highlighting the value of exploring a broader range of predictor variables when developing models, rather than relying solely on climate. Finally, I examined spatial changes to the distribution of suitable habitat for the 29 shrub species that may occur due to climate change. Given uncertainty in the direction of future precipitation changes, I compared distribution patterns that may result under a hot, dry future versus a warm, wet future. In general, the size of suitable habitat was projected to decline for most species, with greater contractions in central and western regions of Australia and some extensions in temperate regions. Importantly, for some species the direction and magnitude of projected changes varied between models calibrated with only climate variables versus those calibrated with climate and soil variables. The net impact of this meant that different regional patterns in species richness may be projected as a result of model calibration and future climate scenario. This thesis has identified the climate envelopes of shrublands and dominant Australian shrub species; highlighted the importance of considering soil properties when modelling plant species distributions; demonstrated potential impacts of climate change and how patterns of species richness may vary depending on whether the future is warm and wet or hot and dry; and revealed uncertainty in projections of future suitable habitat that may occur due to selection of predictor variables.",2015,28/2/2018 6:04,29/6/2021 6:09,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Macquarie University,,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2015,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\GEUVQHKW\Hageer - 2015 - Modelling the distributions of Australian shrublan.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

More recently control of transpiration by plant hydraulic traits has been highlighted, and these as well as stomatal conductance and its response to air saturation vapour pressure deficit remain unstudied for the majority of Australian native tree species. To predict how forested ecosystem water use may change under future climates and enable better estimates of catchment water losses, we must understand stomatal and hydraulic behaviour of trees in the field under a range of conditions. In this study, I quantified traits describing stomatal and hydraulic behaviour for five Eucalyptus species from differing climates. Patterns in whole tree water use, stomatal sensitivity and responses to low water availability of these species in a common garden were correlated with species identity and with their characteristic climate of origin. I found that different Eucalyptus species employed different strategies to deal with water deficits which were linked to hydraulic, anatomical and leaf tissue water relations characteristics, and also with the original climatic range of the species. Tree water use, growth and tolerance of low water availability were enhanced in species mixtures compared to monocultures, an effect ascribed to asymmetric competition of component species in these mixtures. A basis for incorporating species stomatal and hydraulic parameters into forest stand-level water use models is provided. Ultimately, doing so will enhance predictions of water use, and enable estimates of stand water-use efficiency and productivity under current and future climate conditions. The findings are key to inform plantation and land management decisions, and can assist in the identification of vulnerable species or ecosystems, and the conservation of catchment water supplies in a changing climate.",2015,28/2/2018 6:07,14/3/2023 5:40,,,225,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Western Sydney University (Australia),Ann Arbor,English,,PhD,,1943294145,ProQuest,,DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01395.x,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\RHPPU3N2\Sing - 2015 - Forest ecosystem water use does species identity .pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Climate Data
3564VKFP,thesis,2020,"Martin, A.",Persistence through resilience: How sexually deceptive orchids make the most of their pollinators.,,,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2292/53030,"Exploitation of co-operative relationships is found widely in nature and deception can impose acute fitness costs (including death or reproductive loss), so how do these relationships persist? The Australasian Tongue Orchids, Cryptostylis spp. are extreme deceivers: they achieve outstanding pollination rates, eliciting ejaculation from their male wasp pollinator, Lissopimpla excelsa. Here, I use this system to examine individual-level costs and responses to exploitation through field experiments and evaluate population-level responses to sexual deceit using mathematical modelling and a survey of museum and digital records. In my field experiments, I quantify the costs of sperm for orchid pollinators, finding males may become depleted in their lifetime. I also find evidence of localised morphological and behavioural changes in response to orchid deceit. Compared to the same insect species in areas without orchids, male pollinators in areas with orchids have longer antennae, take longer to arrive at an orchid, have shorter orchid mating durations, and have smaller ejaculates. Antennae length does not appear to be a counter-adaptation to deception as it does not confer discriminatory ability. Instead, males with longer antennae had faster response times and were more likely to pollinate orchids. I hypothesise that rather than counter-adaptations, by manipulating population sex-ratios, Cryptostylis orchids enhance the effects of scramble competition in this species: creating males that more readily search for, and pollinate, these orchids. Mathematical modelling shows that a putative 'resilience' trait, haplodiploidy (in which females can reproduce without sperm, albeit only sons), helps exploited pollinators persist when experiencing sperm depletion. Museum and digital records corroborate this finding. I present two models, one from an orchid's and one from a pollinator's perspective. I found that orchids exploiting haplodiploids receive a double advantage: a pollinator resilient to reproductive interference (haplodiploid populations were less likely to become extinct than diploids and had improved female production); and an enhanced supply of males to act as pollinators (orchids that target haplodiploid populations had higher pollination rates than if they were to target diploids). Combined, these findings present a novel mechanism to explain the persistence of costly relationships: resilience. The idea that certain pre-existing life-history traits allow pollinators to cope with exploitation while improving long-term exploiter success.",2020,12/10/2020 3:03,29/6/2021 6:09,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The University of Auckland,"Auckland, New Zealand",not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2020,,-,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\ASKC9UNJ\Martin - 2020 - Persistence through resilience How sexually decep.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Contact for data DOI

Over the past 30 years, an increase in newly-emerging vector-borne pathogens, coupled with the broader dispersal of known pathogens, has resulted in substantial challenges for public health intervention and prevention programs. This burden highlights the need for continued improvement of modeling approaches and prediction methods to help identify areas vulnerable to infection, thereby contributing toward more efficient distributions of limited public health resources.     The field of disease ecology emphasizes interactions between disease system components and the natural environment, recognizing that humans are not always the catalyst for pathogen dispersal and distributions. While incorporating environmental factors in assessing potential pathogen risk is a logical first step, complexities in this approach exist because pathogens are nested within the broader community ecology of host, vector, and reservoir species, and often, not all of these elements are known. Although this element poses challenges to understanding limiting factors of specific environmental pathogens, the multitude of components within individual disease systems offer several avenues from which to study patterns, providing insight into risk. Mosquito vectors are one such component. This knowledge, coupled with advances in geospatial technologies, provides excellent opportunities to model environmental factors contributing to potential pathogen distributions and to help predict disease risk in humans.     Here, I present three ecological modeling approaches to quantify and predict suitable environments, abundances, and connectivity for three mosquito vector species important to human and domestic livestock health.

SJA2J37G,thesis,2017,"Lin, H. Y.",Conserving migratory species under human impacts and climate change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.14264/uql.2017.750,"Migratory species use multiple habitats types and ecosystems to complete their life cycles, which exposes them to multiple human-caused stressors along their migratory routes. Overexploitation, habitat degradation, invasive species and connectivity loss have contributed to the decrease of migratory fishes globally in particular diadromous fishes that migrate between marine and freshwater systems. Therefore, understanding the joint impacts from anthropogenic disturbances and climate change on different habitats (e.g., both feeding and spawning grounds) and habitat connectivity (e.g., migration routes) is important for conserving migratory fish. Management will be most effective when management scales match ecological scales. This is particularly important for conserving migratory species, because of the requirement of multiple connected habitats that may cross local management boundaries. The main goals of this Ph.D. thesis are to quantify the impacts of multiple stressors on migratory fish species and prioritize management actions for conserving populations (chapters 2 & 3), species (chapter 4), and communities (chapter 5). A central challenge for managing diadromous fishes (species that migrate between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems) is to quantify increases in population persistence from actions that improve connectivity or reduce fishing mortality. In chapter 2, I used a population dynamic model and fish movement data to predict the interactive impacts of fishing pressure and connectivity loss by human modification of river flows on Australian bass Percalates novemaculeata. Then, in chapter 3, the monetary cost of management actions which included seasonal closures and restoring connectivity, were included in the model to find the most cost-effective way to conserve this fish population. The results reveal that the cost-effectiveness of management actions may vary with river flow and fishing pressure before implementing management actions, and implementation times. The spatiotemporal dynamics of how fish species and key resource users (i.e., anglers) respond to management actions can influence the effectiveness of management strategies. Flexible management plans and increased cooperation between water and fishery managers can be used to achieve the most effective balance between conserving migratory fish populations and minimising cost. Migratory species are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they occupy different ecosystems, as well as transitional habitat which are all impacted by climate change differently. Anthropogenic barriers can further reduce the ability of species to respond to a shifting climate. In chapter 4, I assessed the impact of climate change on the distribution of a migratory fish species, Australian grayling Prototroctes maraena, and how it affected priorities for restoring connectivity. I found climate change moves at different rates in marine and freshwater systems, decoupling the habitats used by grayling. In addition, the changing spatial distribution of suitable habitats in marine and freshwater systems altered the degree the species was exposed to other anthropogenic disturbances and changed the priorities for where to restore connectivity. In ecosystems that are vulnerable to human impacts, understanding how species assemblages respond to multiple disturbances is a key issue for conservation and environmental management. In chapter 5, I examined changes in fish community structure in Fiji, in response to deforestation, anthropogenic barriers and introduced species. My findings suggest that species traits can be used to predict species loss in modified environments, helps identify the impact of partially-confounded disturbances and may ultimately help tailor conservation actions for the most vulnerable species. This thesis disentangles the interacting impacts of multiple disturbances on migratory species. It outlines a quantitative approach to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of management actions, and the impacts of disturbances across different ecological and management scales. Simple but spatial explicit population model, habitat suitability model and trait-based surrogate were used to overcome the lack of adequate data for non-salmon diadromous species. In a broader sense, it demonstrates that by integrating stressors throughout a species' life cycle can help to optimise conservation effort for migratory species.",2017,28/2/2018 6:01,29/6/2021 6:09,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Queensland,,not specified,,PhD,,,GS 2017,,10.14264/uql.2017.750,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\Q5P8NCRY\s4325990_phd_thesis.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Distributions were derived either from species distribution models (also referred to as �ecological niche models�, �habitat suitability models�, �habitat models� or �bioclimatic envelope models�) created with the program Maxent or from buffered occurrence records cut to suitable areas (for data deficient taxa) and were vetted by experts and modified accordingly. The additional biodiversity hotspot maps (i.e. areas with relatively high concentrations of taxa of conservation concern) included in this collection show the number of taxa within each relevant taxonomic, functional or threatened species status group (e.g. all endangered species or all vulnerable species) of organisms present across the study region. The collection also includes a supplementary spreadsheet (�NESP vetting and taxa information�) with further information on each taxon, such as relevant ecological traits, conservation listings and model details (e.g. thresholds used for Maxent raw outputs, model quality as assessed by experts, AUC/ model fit statistics, cautionary notes on any remaining issues or uncertainties). The collection was created for the purpose of informing conservation decision-making in Northern Australia and was funded by the Australian National Environmental Science Program (NESP) as part of the Northern Australia Environmental Resources Hub.Purpose: The collection was created for the project �Prioritising threatened species and threatening processes across northern Australia�, which was funded by the Australian National Environmental Science Program (NESP) as part of the Northern Australia Environmental Resources Hub. It aimed to provide relevant stakeholders with high quality, high resolution representations of the distribution of relevant taxa to aid with conservation decisions within Northern Australia. Taxa included in the models were considered to be of conservation concern because they were listed under state and federal threatened species legislation, have restricted spatial distributions, or are of other priority concern as indicated by our direct communication with environmental departments of the WA, NT and QLD governments.� The spatial layers were furthermore designed to be used in conjunction with spatiotemporal models of threats potentially affecting these taxa in northern Australia, which are outputs from the second stage of the same project. Distribution layers and threat layers can be combined to estimate spatiotemporal variation in vulnerability (sensitivity vs. exposure) of individual taxa or groups of taxa to particular threats and assist in targeted investment of management actions to conserve these priority species.Lineage Statement:Selection of taxa and sources of distribution dataTaxa were included in this project if they were (i) listed as near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, and/or critically endangered under Australia�s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) and/or under Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia legislation and/or on the IUCN red list. Additional range restricted priority taxa were included on advice of the relevant state and territory environmental departments and based on their listing on the relevant action plans for Australian mammals, birds and fishes. The listings of each taxon at the time of data collation are shown in the additional information spreadsheet �NESP vetting and taxa information� included in this data collection.Distribution models were based on occurrence records extracted from several data bases, including the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), state and territory government data bases managed by the Western Austr lia Parks and Wildlife Service, the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, the Northern Territory Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Victoria Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, and several databases managed by universities, museums or individuals (Frank Koehler from the Australian Museum, Ashley Field and Mel Greenfield from the Australian Tropical Herbarium/ James Cook University, Ian Cowie from the Northern Territory Herbarium, David Westcott from CSIRO, Arthur Georges from the University of Canberra, Mark Kennard from Griffith University, and Mark Hamann from James Cook University).Occurrence records were cleaned (i.e. dubious records excluded) and filtered to the appropriate precision and date range. Any non-Australian records were excluded (however, this only affected a small number of taxa since most were Australian endemics). Cleaning was done according to feedback elicited from experts, information from the literature, and any information on trustworthiness available in the source data bases. Where possible, only records from 1975 or more recent and with precision of 250m or better were used. However, if either of these two filters (precision and date) reduced the number of unique records substantially (by more than half or to less than 20 records), criteria were relaxed (to 1000m or any precision; to all historic records). Records were further reduced to the single most recent and highest precision record per grid cell (all environmental predictor layers used for modelling were rasters with cell size of 0.0025 decimal degrees/~250m; see modelling methods below). Criteria were also relaxed for taxa with spatial bias in either precision or date range of records (e.g. if all records from a certain area had a precision of NA) and for some taxa that have undergone recent range contractions, if these contractions were likely to be related to spatial variation in intensity of threatening processes and not to changes in habitat suitability as described by our set of predictor variables. The latter enabled us to better capture the full set of conditions that define suitable habitat for a taxon; these areas of suitable habitat were subsequently cut to still occupied parts of species ranges according to expert knowledge (see modelling methods below).Environmental predictor variables�Environmental predictor variables used in any of the distribution models were chosen from a larger set of candidate environmental variables depending on each taxon�s ecological traits (such as freshwater dependence, or broad taxonomic affiliation), which was further reduced in a variable selection process. The base set of variables included environmental layers adapted to our required extent, resolution and coordinate system from various sources and included layers based on the National Catchment and Stream Environment Database version 1.1.5 (J.L. Stein, M.F. Hutchinson and J.A. Stein, Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University),� the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS; http://www.environment.gov.au/land/native-vegetation/national-vegetation-information-system), climate layers created using ANUCLIM (http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/research/products/anuclim-vrsn-61), the 9-sec digital elevation model available from Geoscience Australia (https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/search#!a05f7892-d78f-7506-e044-00144fdd4fa6), AusCover foliage projective/forest cover (http://auscover.org.au/purl/landsat-persistent-green-2000-2010) and vegetation height and structure (http://auscover.org.au/purl/icesat-vegetation-structure), dominant lithology (as described in the Bureau of Meteorology Geofabric product groundwater cartography at ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/home/geofabric/), distance to water based water a combination of features described by Bureau of Meteorology Geofabric products at ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/home/geofabric/ and by Geoscience Australia �surface hydrology� products (https://data.gov.au/), distance to coast based on Australia�s oast line as described by IBRA7 products (http://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra), soil properties (depth to regolith, pH, etc.) and soil type (calculated based on combination of sand, silt and clay in top 30cm of soil) as described by the CSIRO �Soil and Landscape Grid National Soil Attribute Maps� at 3-sec resolution (accessed through CSIRO data portal at https://data.csiro.au/dap/home?execution=e1s1), CSIRO soil classification (http://www.asris.csiro.au/themes/NationalGrids.html), fraction photosynthetic active vegetation (�Australia, MODIS-fPAR time series (2000-2014), 9 arcsec (~250 m)� accessed through the BCCVL at� http://www.bccvl.org.au/), and a weathering index (Wilford, J. 2012. A weathering intensity index for the Australian continent using airborne gamma-ray spectrometry and digital terrain analysis, Geoderma 183�184 (2012) 124�142, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.12.022). The full collection of layers from which the subset was selected, and detailed methods on the creation of each layer can be accessed via the Tropical Data Hub (�Pintor, A.; VanDerWal, J.; Graham, E. (2018). High resolution environmental layers for species distribution modeling. James Cook University. http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/28/5a9f2e04d6316).� Species distribution modelling & vettingFor any taxon with 10 or less remaining records, simple distribution models were created by buffering occurrences and cutting buffers to areas with conditions similar to those observed at actual occurrence locations (for example, freshwater associated taxa were cut to areas not further from streams than observed at any of the occurrence records). Buffer size was specified according to a taxon�s extent of occurrence and number of records to allow for greater buffers for wide ranging taxa (likely greater dispersal capacities and sample gaps between known occurrences) and smaller buffers for more well sampled taxa within their extent of occurrence (less uncertainty about sample gaps between known occurrences). Experts were then consulted to choose the final buffer radius from three: our recommended buffer distance (based on the reasoning described above), half our recommendation, or twice our recommendation. For each taxon with over 50 records, we ran 10-fold cross-validated Maxent models (Steven J. Phillips, Miroslav Dud�k, Robert E. Schapire. Maximum Entropy Modeling of Species Geographic Distributions; Version 3.3.3, 2010) and performed variable selection: variable performance was ranked according to permutation importance, the best variables with a permutation importance of > 1% were selected, and this list further shortened to retain up to 10 variables for taxa with under 100 records and one variable per 10 occurrence records for taxa with over 100 records to balance the risk of overfitting models with providing the sufficient detail on habitat characteristics. The remaining variables were used to run a final Maxent model. For taxa with 11 to 50 records, Maxent models were created, but variable selection was based on summaries of best performing variables for other taxa with similar traits (from the set with more than 50 records discussed above).Each model went through an expert vetting process where experts on the different taxonomic or functional groups decided on a threshold, excluded dubious records, clarified taxonomic changes and inaccuracies, and identified areas that were predicted as suitable but are known or expected to be unoccupied. Final models were run with the vetted data and outputs were cut and thresholded accordingly. Occurrence thresholds were selected by experts from the following options; the Maxent threshold suggested options of (T1) �Equal training sensitivity and specificity� or (T2) �Equate entropy of thresholded and original distributions�; (T3) the most severe of the two thresholds T1 or T2 multiplied by 2 (if less than 0.35) or divided by 2 (if higher than 0.35 which was rarely the case) - this option aimed to provide an �extreme� alternative to the traditional thresholds because it may be that predictions for ranges of poorly sampled species are too strict (lack of representation of full range of occupied conditions) or for highly restricted species too generous (underestimates of specialists� dependence on exact conditions); (T4) a constant strict threshold of 0.5; (T5) an individual threshold nominated by the expert if all other thresholds were deemed inappropriate. Detailed information on which type of threshold was used for each taxon, which areas were cut are specified in the spreadsheet �NESP vetting and taxa information�, which is part of this collection.�These thresholds in the spreadsheet apply to the original Maxent outputs and NOT to the final distribution maps. Final model versions were rescaled to within the range of suitabilities included in the cut and thresholded output (for example if the raw suitability output ranged from 0 to 1 and the expert selected threshold was 0.4, the resulting range of suitabilities from 0.4-1 was rescaled to the full range of within realized habitat� suitability of 0-1). This was done to make final models for different taxa comparable. One reason this was necessary was that some threatened subspecies are under-sampled and underrepresented in whole-species models. For example for species with many East Coast records and few records for one isolated subspecies in the Kimberley, Maxent will treat latter as outliers and underpredict suitability in the Kimberley. However, such isolated subspecies are often the ones of greatest conservation concern. Because cresating useful models for conservation decisoons was the primary goal of this project, the rescaled final versions for each of the modelled subspecies was merged to the final version of the rescaled overall species model to fill in any such gaps.�All models ran through three vetting rounds: initial models were vetted by experts and corrections applied, models were then rerun and re-vetted by co-investigators (to make sure that original expert comments were still represented accurately in the new versions and that any potential previous oversights were corrected); lastly a small set of models with remaining inaccuracies was rerun with final modifications and quality checked again.Model outputs and suggested appropriate useAvailable files for each taxon include the following (binary suitable/unsuitable maps� g-l exist for all taxa, continuous suitability outputs a-f only for Maxent based models, not for buffer based models):a) 10km resolution distribution map (rescaled suitability index 0 to 1/ expert vetted unoccupied areas set to 0) � �taxon_currentG10km.asc�;�b) 250m resolution distribution map (rescaled suitability index 0 to 1/ expert vetted unoccupied areas set to 0) � �taxon_currentG.asc;�c) 250m resolution distribution map (suitability index 0 to 1/ expert vetted unoccupied areas set to 0) � applied threshold relaxed by 0.1 ��taxon_currentGSL.asc�;�d) 250m resolution distribution map (rescaled suitability index 0 to 1/ expert vetted unoccupied areas NOT set to 0) ��taxon_currentGuncut.asc�;�e) 250m resolution distribution map (rescaled suitability index 0 to 1/ expert vetted unoccupied areas NOT set to 0) � applied threshold relaxed by 0.1��taxon_currentGuncutSL.asc�;�f) 250m resolution distribution map (rescaled suitability index 1 to 2/ expert vetted unoccupied areas 0 to 1) ��taxon_currentCG.asc�;g) 10km resolution distribution map (1=suitable and likely occupied/ 0=unsuitable or vetted unoccupied) � taxon_currentF10km.asc;h) 250m resolution distribution map (1=suitable and likely occupied/ 0=unsuitable or vetted unoccupied) � taxon_currentF.asc;�i) 250m resolution distribution map (1=suitable and likely occupied/ 0=unsuitable or vetted unoccupied) � applied threshold relaxed by 0.1 � �taxon_currentFSL.asc�;�j) 250m resolution distribution map (1=suitable - may or may not be occupied/ 0=unsuitable) ��taxon_currentFuncut.asc�;�k) 250m resolution distribution map (1=suitable - may or may not be occupied/ 0=unsuitable) � applied threshold relaxed by 0.1��taxon_currentFuncutSL.asc�;�l) 250m resolution distribution map (2=suitable and likely occupied/ 1=suitable but vetted unoccupied/ 0=unsuitable) ��taxon_currentCF.asc�;Model versions with relaxed thresholds are intended to allow for users to estimate uncertainty around recommended cut off points for distributions, and aim to describe areas where the taxon �may occur� but is not necessarily �likely to occur�. These are to be used with caution as they are not based on expert vetting. For high resolution models, gradual and 0/1 outputs are furthermore provided as a (I) final version cut to areas recommended by experts (b/h), (II) pre-cutting versions that include areas predicted to be suitable but unlikely to be occupied (d/j), and (III) a combined version showing cut out areas as low suitability scores as well as actually vetted-occupied areas as higher suitability scores. Versions including unoccupied but potentially suitable areas were provided in case they are needed for translocation projects and to capture any remaining uncertainty but should be used with caution. For publically available 10km models only the final, vetted-occupied, vetted-threshold versions are provided.�Versions with 10 km resolu ion are intended for public use and are intended to be made available through the Atlas of Living Australia and the Department of Environment and Energy (DoEE) Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN) public web resources, while all 250m resolution versions include detailed information on the distributions of sensitive species, should only be used for conservation purposes and are only intended to be distributed on request by JCU, DoEE ERIN and relevant state/ territory government departments that have been granted distribution privileges by JCU or ERIN.We furthermore produced hotspot maps that show how many taxa of conservation concern co-occur across our study region. Such hotspot maps were created for several taxa, functional groups, or groups of taxa with similar conservation listing and aim to indicate which areas may be in particular need of certain sets of conservation actions, how adequate current protected areas are for the conservation of certain groups, and/or how the distribution of threatened taxa corresponds to general distributions of biodiversity. For comparison with general distribution patterns of biodiversity we recommend products provided by CliMAS (Climate change and biodiversity in Australia; http://climas.hpc.jcu.edu.au/). Hotspot maps were created by summing all unique species (i.e. subspecies listed as threatened were only included once by using the merged overall species model) within each pre-defined group predicted to be present in each grid cell (according to 250m resolution vetted-occupied vetted-threshold model versions). Outputs were clipped to our study region because only northern taxa were modelled and any patterns outside of the study region would be misleading as they don�t include the set of taxa of relevance there. High resolution hotspot models are intended for conservation purposes as well as public use because any species-specific sensitive information is disguised.� This collection is comprised of raster layers of present day distributions of terrestrial and freshwater taxa that are of conservation concern in Northern Australia, which includes the Australian Conservation Management Zones �North Australian Tropical Savanna� and �North Eastern Australia Tropical Rainforests� and drainage basins intersecting these regions boundaries.� Distributions were derived either from Maxent models or from buffered occurrence records and were vetted by experts and modified accordingly. The additional conservation hotspot maps included in this collection show the number of taxa within each relevant taxonomic, functional or conservation group of organisms present across the study region.

These models use best-available biological data extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia current to 26th February 2014 and spatial environmental predictor data compiled at 9 second resolution (with novel climate seasonality predictors, undersampling covariates and >3 species aggregated per 9-second grid cell). The models were developed to underpin continental assessments of biodiversity significance and identify gaps in biological surveys. GDM is a statistical technique that models the dissimilarity in composition of species between pairs of surveyed locations, as a function of environmental differences between these locations. The compositional dissimilarity between a given pair of locations can be thought of as the proportion of species occurring at one location that do not occur at the other location (averaged across the two locations) - ranging from 0 if the two locations have exactly the same species through to 1 if they have no species in common. GDM effectively weights and transforms the environmental variables such that distances between locations in this transformed multidimensional environmental space now correlate, as closely as possible, with the observed biological compositional dissimilarities between these same locations. Once a GDM model has been fitted to the biological data from the sampled locations using environmental predictor data, it can be used to predict compositional dissimilarity values for sites lacking biological data, based purely on their mapped environmental attributes. For this purpose, a set of GDM-scaled environmental grids are produced for use in subsequent spatial assessments of biodiversity significance. This collection includes the source biological and environmental data, the GDM-fitted model, the GDM-scaled environmental predictors for the fitted-model which comprises substrate (constant) and 1990-centred climates, and a derived classification.

32FRQEP4,thesis,2021,"Starkie, M.L.",Systematics and evolution of the Australian Dacini (Diptera: Tephritidae),,,,,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/207990,"The Dacini fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) are a widely distributed clade that occupy tropical and subtropical forests across Africa, South-east Asia, Australia, and the Pacific. While there are existing systematic studies on this group, the Australian and Pacific fauna have been under-sampled and deeper evolutionary questions neglected. This study produces a molecular phylogenetic reconstruction based on targeted sampling of the Australian and Pacific Dacini in order to investigate biogeographic, systematic and evolutionary questions about the tribe. The overarching aim of this thesis was to produce a Dacini phylogenetic tree and apply this tree to evolutionary, taxonomic and biogeographical questions concerning the group. The main aims of each chapter were to: (i) employ a targeted sampling method to expand the taxonomic and geographic collections available for analysis (Chapter 2); (ii) produce a multi-locus molecular phylogenetic tree (Chapter 3) and then, (iii) use this tree to investigate phylogenetic signal of the traits: male lure response and host breadth (Chapter 3); (iv) evaluate the ability of morphological character traits to resolve phylogenetic relationships (Chapter 4); (v) investigate the influence of biogeography in the Australian and Pacific region on divergence of the regional Dacini (Chapter 5); (vi) investigate basal lineages and inform a taxonomic review of the Bactrocera aglaiae species group (Chapter 6); and (vii) reconcile new genetic data with previous taxonomic relationships (based on morphology) in a taxonomic review of the Bactrocera tryoni species group (Chapter 7). In Chapter 2, species were sampled along the east coast of Australia, using a combination of male lures, protein baits and fruit rearing in order to expand existing collections. Over 8600 specimens were collected during this study. New geographic distributions are recorded for five species, new lure responses are recorded for three species, a new species is described based on morphology. Chapter 3 utilised 144 described species from Australia, the Pacific, and South-east Asia for a phylogenetic reconstruction of the tribe Dacini. The Bactrocera aglaiae species group was resolved as the oldest Bactrocera clade sampled in this study, distributed in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Consistent with other molecular phylogenies of the Dacini, there was poor agreement between systematic placement of species in the phylogeny and their morphologically based taxonomic placement at the subgeneric and species complex levels. Divergence time estimates provided dates that were younger than the only previously dated phylogeny of this group, with the tribe estimated as diverging from its most recent common ancestor 43 million years ago. Ancestral trait reconstruction and tests for phylogenetic signal revealed that male lure response exhibits strong phylogenetic signal across the tree. Host diet breadth also exhibited phylogenetic signal, but was not as strong. My phylogeny, like others before it, found poor alignment between Dacini systematic placements based on molecular data versus morphological data. Chapter 4 evaluated colour patterns and structural characters that are typically used in descriptions and diagnosis of Dacini species for their utility in phylogenetic reconstruction. When compared against datasets that contained only molecular data, the AU test found there was no significant improvement to the resolution of the tree when morphological characters were added to a molecular dataset. When morphological characters were used to reconstruct a phylogeny alone, species were not able to be resolved at the generic or species levels in a way congruent with current systematic understanding of the group. Chapter 5 utilised the dated phylogeny from Chapter 3 to investigate divergence pathways. The analysis found that regional Dacini species moved eastward into the Pacific from Papua New Guinea and Australia, and that there was no westward movement of species back into those regions. There was evidence of multiple incursions via the Torres Strait land bridge into and out of Australia and Papua New Guinea, both in deeper and more recent evolutionary time. Within Australia, species have moved westward into the Northern Territory and southward out of north Queensland. There is no evidence, given the present-day distributions of fruit flies, that biogeographical land barriers have played a significant role in fruit fly speciation within Australia. In Chapter 6 a taxonomic review of the Bactrocera aglaiae species group is provided. This included resolution of discrepancies between the descriptions of the holotype, and previous descriptions based on paratypes. Within the review, new species descriptions and identification of variation was provided. In addition, likelihood mapping tests confirmed the clade as the oldest Bactrocera clade. The systematics of the Bactrocera tryoni species complex, which contains several of Australia's most important fruit fly pest species, was investigated in detail in Chapter 7 of the thesis based on paraphyly of species in the phylogeny produced in Chapter 3. Utilising a reduced genome source of SNP data, sequence data and morphological observations, it was found that the traditional concept of the complex as containing four species (B. tryoni, B. neohumeralis, B. aquilonis and B. melas) needed to be enlarged to include B. ustulata, B. erubescentis, B. mutabilis and B. curvipennis. Further B. humilis (a taxa morphologically very similar to B. tryoni) and B. melas showed no genetic evidence consistent with them being true species. To accommodate the extra species, the B. tryoni complex was taxonomically redefined as a species group, B. tryoni was redescribed, and B. humilis and B. melas were synonymised with B. tryoni. The potential for unrecognised cryptic species, morphologically similar to B. tryoni and B. neohumeralis, existing within the group is discussed. Chapter 8 presents my final thoughts for the future of Dacini taxonomy and systematics. I recommend subgeneric groups be removed from use in Dacini taxonomy due to their lack of utility. In addition, using the term 'species group' instead of 'species complex' is also recommended based on the confusion this has caused other taxonomists. A case study using the B. frauenfeldi species complex is provided as an example of how results from each chapter can be used to investigate difficult species groups. Finally, I conclude by acknowledging this thesis has developed a comprehensive dataset which is a good starting point for any investigation of key species groups, trait analysis and large-scale biogeographic analyses.",2021,6/4/2021 0:42,15/3/2023 4:13,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Queensland University of Technology,"Brisbane, Australia",English,,PhD,,,GS 2021,,10.5204/thesis.eprints.207990,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\ZT4YPHYF\Starkie - 2021 - Systematics and evolution of the Australian Dacini.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Modern ecologists are given the task of determining how to predict and then mitigate species' response to such disturbances. Species with larger niches, and more behaviorally flexible species, are predicted to better succeed in novel environments in the face of large scale habitat changes (Mayr 1965, Ehlrich 1989, Sol 2002, Shultz 2005). Foraging behavior can be a good descriptor of species' niches, and the variation in these measures can be used to quantify behavioral flexibility (Sol 2002). My dissertation utilizes the interface between animal behavior data and broad-scale ecological patterns. I collected foraging behavior data (∼7,300 independent foraging observations) across 74 of 75 Australian honeyeater (Meliphagidae) species to quantify niche size and position. I used functional dispersion (FDis) to quantify niche size. Related species foraged similarly, and foraging behavior showed significant phylogenetic signal. Generalists utilized a variety of resource acquisition strategies, whereas species with small niches were either highly nectarivorous or insectivorous. In order to determine if foraging niche size can be a predictor of extinction risk, I tested whether niche size was correlated with exposure or sensitivity to climate change. I did not find niche size to be a significant predictor of these risks as assessed by others. However, synergistic effects between small niche size and anthropogenic disturbance and climate change may put these species at an elevated risk of extinction. I also found a strong positive relationship between species that are highly nectarivorous and species that make attacks to the air for invertebrates. Nectarivorous species supplement their diets with protein, and it appears that these species make costly aerial attacks to acquire protein quickly. Geographic range size was not correlated with foraging niche size, but it was weakly correlated with niche position. Specifically, species that glean and hang from leaves in forests with high canopies were found to have smaller geographic range sizes. This is likely driven by the fact that such forests occur over a limited area in Australia, and occupy only remnants of their former geographic extent.",2015,28/2/2018 6:08,9/3/2021 6:39,,,131,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Colorado at Boulder,Ann Arbor,English,,Ph.D.,,1719140004,ProQuest,,-,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\6VPEGRQH\Wagner - 2015 - Foraging behavior, behavioral flexibility, and ran.pdf",,1 - ALA used; Climate Data

The Level 1 assessment identified ecological components at higher risk from line fishing activities, and these were progressed to a Level 2 assessment. Level 2 ERAs are focused at the species level with risk evaluations based on a Productivity & Susceptibility Analysis (PSA). The PSA evaluates risk for each species through an assessment of seven biological attributes and up to seven fisheries-specific attributes. This Level 2 ERA examined the risk posed to 35 target & byproduct species (Other Species quota management unit), and four protected teleosts. Collectively, 17 species were found to be at high risk from line fishing activities, and the remaining 22 species were assessed as a medium risk. Risk profiles were influenced by data deficiencies, an underdeveloped management regime, and cumulative fishing pressures. For a portion of these species, final risk ratings were precautionary and are more representative of the potential risk. Management of precautionary risks beyond what is already being undertaken as part of the Queensland Sustainable Fisheries Strategy 2017-2027 is not considered a priority. The Level 2 ERA made a list of recommendations to assist in the management and mitigation of risk in the Reef Line Fishery. A number of these measures are already being discussed or addressed through the Queensland Sustainable Fisheries Strategy 2017-2027 and the Reef Line Fishery Harvest Strategy.

V2JJU2ST,report,2021,"Scherneck, Sam",International survey explores how risk assessment tools for invasive species can be utilized successfully,,,,,,"Over the last few decades, the value of risk assessment tools in predicting biological invasions has become widely recognized. Risk assessment tools for invasive species are applied in a wide variety of contexts, with assessors operating in all parts of the world, in conjunction with many types of organizations, and with various objectives. We know that assessors' access to resources (including funding, training, data, and tools) often depends on where they work, what taxa they study, and what organizations they are associated with. However, we still lack a complete picture of precisely where, why, and how risk assessment tools are most frequently implemented. A clearer understanding of what tools work well in certain situations and what resources are necessary to use them will help assessors to select the correct tool for their situation. We also know little about whether the application of these tools (including the time, labor, and data that are used, as well as whether the output meets widely held standards for risk assessment) is influenced by situational factors (including where and why risk assessment is conducted, and what tools are used). I surveyed risk assessors, asking them questions about where and why they conduct risk assessment, what resources they use throughout the process, and how their results are used by the scientific community. Responses to my questionnaire suggest that risk assessment for invasive species is most commonly conducted for terrestrial plant species in western industrialized nations by workers for government agencies and research institutions, although many different risk assessment tools are used. I also found that uncertainty and peer review were often incorporated into the results, but that the results were often not made publicly accessible. Furthermore, I found that the situational contexts in which risk assessment is applied often influence the tools and data that are utilized, the extent to which uncertainty and peer review are included in the results, and the way the results are shared. My survey provides a clearer picture of how risk assessment is being applied, which aspects of risk assessment work well, and which aspects could use improvement.",2021,21/9/2021 2:28,22/3/2023 3:42,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,School of Natural Resources and Environment,"Florida, United States of America",English,,,,,Zotero,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DQJZ2ME2\Scherneck - International survey explores how risk assessment .pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned
6LJIENNF,preprint,2021,"Mata, Luis; Vogel, Blythe; Palma, Estibaliz; Malapatil, Mallik",The arrival and spread of the European firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus in Australia as documented by citizen scientists,,,,,https://osf.io/4a3sh,"We present evidence of the recent introduction and quick spread of the European firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus in Australia, as documented on the citizen science platform iNaturalist. The first public record of the species was reported in December 2018 in the City of Brimbank (Melbourne, Victoria). Since then, the species distribution has quickly expanded into 15 local government areas surrounding this first observation, including areas in both Metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. The number of records of the European firebug in Victoria has also seen a substantial increase, with a current tally of almost 100 observations in iNaturalist as of July 31st, 2021. The case of the European firebug in Australia adds to the list of examples of citizen scientists playing a key role in not only early detection of newly introduced species but in documenting their expansion across their non-native range. Citizen science presents an exciting opportunity to complement biosecurity efforts carried out by government agencies, which often lack resources to sufficiently fund detection and monitoring programs given the overwhelming number of current and potential invasive species. Recognising and supporting the invaluable contribution of citizen scientists to science and society can help reduce this gap by: (1) increasing the number of introduced species that are quickly detected; (2) gathering evidence of the species' early expansion stage; and (3) prompting adequate monitoring and rapid management plans for potentially harmful species.Given the range expansion patterns of the European firebug worldwide, their adaptation ability, and future climate scenarios, we suspect this species will continue expanding beyond Victoria, including other parts of Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific. We firmly believe that most of the knowledge about how this expansion process continues to happen will be provided by citizen scientists.",1/9/2021,21/9/2021 2:37,22/3/2023 1:07,21/9/2021 2:37,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,EcoEvoRxiv,,not specified,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.32942/osf.io/4a3sh,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\2KTMD28F\Mata et al_2021_The arrival and spread of the European firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus in Australia.pdf,,4 - ALA acknowledged

Despite similar gross leaf morphology, eucalypt species are often confined to specific climate envelopes across the variable rainfall environments of Australia. In this study, we investigate how the progression of cavitation differs among eucalypts and whether this is related to other hydraulic and physical leaf traits. We used the Optical Visualisation technique to capture cavitation progression across the leaves of eight eucalypt species (             Angophora crassifolia, Corymbia tessellaris, Eucalyptus atrata, Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus laevopinea, Eucalyptus longifolia, Eucalyptus macrandra, Eucalyptus tereticornis             ) from a wide range of climates and grown in a common garden setting. Vulnerability to cavitation, represented by the leaf water potential required for 50% cavitation of leaf vessels, varied significantly among species (-3.48 MPa to -8.25 MPa) and correlated linearly with home climate precipitation and leaf SLA (             R             2             of 0.64 and 0.75, respectively). P12-P88, the range of water potentials between which 12% to 88% of cavitation occurs, was decoupled from P50 but also correlated with leaf SLA (             R             2             of 0.72). We suggest the magnitude of P12-P88 may be representative of a species' drought strategy - a large P12-P88 signifying leaves that exhibit drought tolerance (retention of leaves under drought conditions) and a small P12-P88 signifying drought avoidance (leaf shedding after a threshold of drought is reached). Our results agree with other studies that highlight these cavitation metrics as genetically fixed traits. Turgor loss point, on the other hand, may be more plastic, as evidenced by the low variability of this trait across these eucalypt species grown in a common garden environment. Further study will help to establish the SLA-related anatomical traits that impart cavitation resistance and to extend these conclusions to a greater number of species and home climates.",6/9/2021,21/9/2021 7:12,22/3/2023 1:06,21/9/2021 7:12,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Plant Biology,"Sydney, Australia",English,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/2021.09.05.459049,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\YNKC879W\Coleman et al_2021_Vulnerability to cavitation is linked to home climate precipitation across.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Spatial Portal
ECE5NFRV,thesis,2021,"Morgan, Liesel",Taxonomy and systematics of Chasmoptera (Neuroptera: Nemopteridae: Nemopterinae): assessing the species status of Western Australia's only spoon-wing lacewing genus.,,,,,,"Chasmoptera is a genus of charismatic spoon-wing lacewings (Neuroptera: Nemopteridae: Nemopterinae) endemic to Western Australia. There are currently only three described species in this genus: C. hutti (Westwood 1848), C. superba (Tillyard 1925) and C. mathewsi (Koch 1967). Little is known of the evolution or biology of these insects, though some inferences about the genus can be made from commonalities to other members of the Nemopteridae and Nemopterinae from other continents. A defining feature of Chasmoptera is their elaborate extended hindwings, with apical dilations arranged in a ""ribbon"" or ""spoon"" shape. Species delimitation methods for this genus have relied predominantly on hindwing morphology (with some forewing and genital morphology) to determine species. In recent years there have been collections of Chasmoptera individuals from several different populations, many differing slightly in appearance from the three known species. The aims of this research were to assess the species status of approximately five putative new Chasmoptera species, provisionally identified by their hindwing morphology, and examine hindwing variation across the genus using morphometric analyses. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data was used to further delimit species and the phylogenetic relationships among the species of Chasmoptera were established. Delimitation analyses identified two likely new species: Chasmoptera ""AE"" and Chasmoptera ""PG"". The unique hindwing morphology of another, isolated population (C. ""Lake Grace"") revealed another likely new species, for which DNA data could not be obtained. Morphometric analysis showed that males have greater shape variation in their hindwings than females, consistent with the male hindwings being under sexual selection. K-means clustering presented some shape trends, although the patterns of species delimitation that were defined for the known and putative new species (whom had previously been identified by hindwing shape) were not maintained. Unexpectedly, the molecular delimitation of species did not directly support the morphological delimitation of species, or vice versa. The results of this study present the first molecular phylogeny of Chasmoptera and tentatively double the number of known species, creating a basis for further study of Nemopterinae in Western Australia and beyond.",2021,22/9/2021 4:37,22/12/2021 4:09,,,79,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Murdoch University,,English,,,,,Zotero,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\BK5PNWTK\Morgan_2021_Taxonomy and systematics of Chasmoptera (Neuroptera.pdf,,2 - ALA cited; Species occurrence records; Spatial Portal

Exmouth Gulf is a large marine embayment (~ 3000 km2 ) dominated by soft sediment habitats that have been extensively trawled for commercial prawn fisheries. The reef and mangrove fish communities are poorly known. Marine fishes were sampled from seventeen sites, with 15 in Exmouth Gulf and two just outside the gulf on the west side of the peninsula. Sites were accessed by road, boat and helicopter and collections were made both intertidally and subtidally, on SCUBA or snorkel, using anaesthetics, spears and a variety of nets. A total of 78 species were collected as museum vouchers, including tissue samples and photographs from all species. No introduced or threatened fauna was identified. Important outcomes include substantially improved spatial resolution for the distribution of the region's fish fauna and significant range extension and infill records for 9 species. Noteworthy outcomes from this work included the first fish collections made from the southern gulf mangroves and the identification, elsewhere in the gulf, of relatively intact reef habitats that support diverse and healthy fish communities.

Large groups can now resolve issues together in completely different ways, which has transformed the arts, sciences, business, education, technology, and medicine. Collective intelligence is something we share with animals and is different from machine learning and artificial intelligence. To design and utilize human collective intelligence, we must understand how its problem-solving mechanisms work. From democracy in ancient Athens, through the invention of the printing press, to COVID-19, this book analyzes how humans developed the ability to find solutions together.

QKKHRQQX,report,2021,"Hale, Jennifer",Lake Colac Water Reclamation Plant Upgrade: Ecological Risk Assessment,,,,,,"The Colac Wastewater Reclamation Plant (WRP) is located on the south eastern shore of Lake Colac in the Western Victorian town of Colac. The WRP treats industrial and domestic wastewater from the town of Colac, producing Class C recycled water discharged to Lake Colac under a Victorian EPA Licence. Barwon Water is planning an upgrade of the Colac WRP, which will require a Works Approval and an associated licence amendment from EPA Victoria. As a part of the works approval, an environmental risk assessment (ERA), consistent with the Victorian EPA Guidelines for Risk Assessment of Wastewater Discharges to Waterways (EPA Victoria 2009) is required. This report provides an ERA on the potential environmental impacts (both positive and negative) associated with Barwon Water's proposed upgrade to the Colac WRP to the receiving waters (Lake Colac) in accordance with EPA Guidelines for Risk Assessment of Wastewater Discharges to Waterways (EPA Victoria 2009). Lake Colac was once a permanent waterbody, but the effects of climate change and drainage schemes have resulted in a lake that periodically dries and has a more variable water regime.The lake is turbid, alkaline and eutrophic, but supports several beneficial uses and values including: a diversity and abundance of waterbirds, commercial and recreational fishing and water-based recreation. The Colac WRP has operated within its EPA discharge licence conditions for the past five years but has occasional peak ammonia concentrations above guideline values. The planned upgrade will increase the discharge volume over time from a maximum of 5.7 ML/day to 7 ML/day. Barwon Water have made a commitment to reduce the licence quality limits associated with the discharge with a reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations.The upgrade will also result in a significant improvement in the worst-case peak ammonia concentration in the effluent.",2021-08,6/12/2021 5:24,24/3/2023 0:59,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Jennifer Hale Aquatic Ecology Consultant,"Kilmore, Australia",not specified,,Consultants Report,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\7PGLBXQD\Hale_2021_Lake Colac Water Reclamation Plant Upgrade.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

The Survey Area is located approximately 33 km south of Marble Bar in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and covers an area of approximately 230 hectares (ha). The key objective of the survey was to determine the likely presence and distribution of any SRE invertebrate fauna of conservation significance to support environmental impact assessments. A desktop assessment and survey were carried out in a manner consistent with Western Australian (WA) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) environmental surveying and reporting of fauna. From the desktop assessment, four Confirmed SRE, and eight Potential SRE taxa were identified as having been recorded from locations ranging from within the Survey Area up to 40 km from the Survey Area. These taxa included mygalomorph spiders, pseudoscorpions, scorpions, polydesmid millipedes, and terrestrial isopods. Three Potential SRE taxa were recorded within the Survey Area: these were two scorpions (Lychas `bituberculatus complex` and Lychas `hairy tail complex`), and one terrestrial isopod (Buddelundiinae `mw`). None of these taxa are restricted to the Survey Area. The single season survey was undertaken to target the Stage 2 Development Envelope to supplement previous SRE surveys of the area. Thirty sites were assessed in May 2020 of which, twelve sites were sampled for SRE invertebrates. Forty-one invertebrate specimens from known SRE groups were collected from the twelve sites sampled. Invertebrates were collected from microhabitats in leaf litter, soil, and under rocks. The specimens were predominantly pseudoscorpions, with forty specimens collected, along with one selenopid spider. These specimens were identified as Indolpium sp. CRD1, Indolpium sp. CRD2, Xenolpium sp. CRD1, and Karaops sp. indet. No Confirmed SRE taxa were identified, with all four taxa considered Potential SRE. It is considered unlikely that any of these taxa are restricted to the Survey Area. Further analysis supported this with the Karaops sp. indet. confirmed as being genetically identical to Karaops sp. indet. 2, found in similar habitat in the greater Sanjiv Ridge Study Area. Habitat assessment at each site classified the Survey Area into five habitat types: Gorge/ Gully, Hillcrest/ Hillslope, Medium Drainage Lines, Undulating Low Hills, and Stony Plain, and ranked each site in terms of SRE habitat suitability. The majority of the Survey Area was found to be represented by moderate (33.3%) and low (63.9%) suitability habitat. The amount of highly suitable habitat within the Survey Area was minimal (3.3%); only four sites in the Survey Area were considered of high suitability, Gorge/ Gully habitat.",2021-08,1/12/2021 3:08,24/3/2023 0:59,12/1/2021,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Biologic,Australia,not specified,,Consultants Report,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\25XW2JTT\Lythe_Gunawardene_2021_Sanjiv Ridge Stage 2 Development Area - Short Range Endemic Invertebrate Fauna.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

4L4SYSE8,report,2021,"Taylor, Dianne B J; Dhileepan, K",Application to release Stomphastis sp. nov. an agent for the biological control of Jatropha gossypiifolia in Australia,,,,,https://www.dcceew.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/stomphastis-thraustica-applicants-assessment.pdf,"Jatropha gossypiifolia (Euphorbiaceae), commonly known as bellyache bush, is a serious weed of rangelands and riparian zones of northern Australia, and it has the potential to invade much of northern Australia. Biological control is an important component of the long-term management strategy for J. gossypiifolia in Australia. Biological control of bellyache bush was initiated in 1999. Since then, only one agent, the jewel bug, Agonosoma trilineatum has been released and there is no evidence of its establishment. A renewed biological control effort, involving exploration in South America identified a number of potential biological control agents, the most promising of which, a small leaf-mining moth Stomphastis sp. nova (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), was imported from Peru into quarantine in 2014 for further research. Biological studies conducted in quarantine demonstrated that Stomphastis sp. nov. has both a short generation time and high fecundity. Under quarantine conditions at 30oC, a generation has been completed in as little as 13 days. This bodes well for its future as a biological control agent, allowing populations to build rapidly under favourable conditions. Stomphastis sp. nov. can complete development on all six biotypes of bellyache bush identified in Australia and shows no apparent preference. Gracillariidae are also known to be good dispersers. It is expected that Stomphastis sp. nova will also be an adept disperser, a desirable characteristic given the expansive areas across which J. gossypiifolia occurs. The host plant test list for the quarantine host testing of Stomphastis sp. nov. contains 50 species. The list focuses on phylogenetically related native species occurring in northern Australia where J. gossypiifolia is invasive. Several species recorded as hosts of S. thraustica (a close congener) were also included. Host specificity testing was conducted as follows (Figure 1): 1. No choice oviposition/larval development trials: All test species were subject to no-choice trials. Indiscriminate egg lay under confined and/or no no-choice conditions is known to occur in many Lepidoptera. Eggs were laid on 35 species and egg hatch (utilising resources from the egg) occurred on 28 of these species. In all cases, except on J. gossypiifolia and J. curcas, the 1st instar larvae died, shortly after attempting to feed, demonstrating that these species are not suitable hosts for larval development and thus lifecycle completion. Exploratory feeding only affected the surface layers of leaves before the death of the larvae. 2. Paired choice comparison trial: This was conducted for species on which larval development occurred (J. curcas). Jatropha curcas was found to be equally as acceptable as a host as J. gossypiifolia under quarantine conditions. Jatropha curcas has also invaded parts of northern Australia. It is a declared weed in some states and is an approved target for biological control. Utilisation of this species in the field by Stomphastis sp. nov. would thus be beneficial. 3. Choice oviposition trials: These were conducted with 23 of the species on which eggs were laid during no-choice trials. When provided with a choice of the target and several non-target species, very few eggs were laid on the non-target species and in no cases did larvae develop beyond first instar on non-target species, including on two close relatives. These results further demonstrate that these species are not suitable hosts. 4. Multiple-choice oviposition trial, without J. gossypiyfolia: This was conducted with six species on which high numbers of eggs were laid during no-choice trials. No eggs were laid on any of the plants in any of the replicates. Results from quarantine host testing confirm that Stomphastis sp. nov. is highly host specific and suitable for release in Australia. In no cases was larval development possible past the first instar on any species other than the target and J. curcas. The risk to species other than J. cucas is therefore predicted to be negligible.",2021-10,14/12/2021 3:05,24/3/2023 1:06,,48,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Queensland Government Department of Agriculture and Fisheries,"Queensland, Australia",English,,,,,Zotero,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UC7MGIY2\Taylor and Dhileepan - Application to release Stomphastis sp. nov. an age.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Supported through the Australian Governments Regional Bushfire Recovery Fund, the program includes funding for a Citizen Science Coordinator position based within the Atlas of Living Australia hosted by the CSIRO to support the delivery of three bushfire recovery projects. Minister for the Environment Sussan Ley said citizen science projects present a unique opportunity to improve the science on bushfires, future preparations and bushfire actions. Three projects under the program are supporting fire-affected communities to engage with nature and the science of recovery, Minister Ley said. The first project will see CSIRO run a series of weekend long BioBlitz events in bushfire-affected regions across NSW to generate new evidence on the impacts of large-scale fire on biodiversity. A BioBlitz is a collaborative event to discover and record as many living things as possible within a set location and period of time and will involve both scientists and the general public. The $485,000 program includes two other projects which will develop resources to support citizen scientists to monitor post-fire plant recovery and identify active threats, and to digitise historic invertebrate records, ensuring their ongoing value, Minister Ley said. Volunteers have digitised and transcribed thousands of specimens so far from CSIROs National Insect Collection using the DigiVol platform, getting us off to an incredible start. The BioBlitz events will be delivered by CSIRO in partnership with the Australian Citizen Science Association, University of New South Wales Environment Recovery Project and Minderoos Fire and Flood Initiative. With partners from Western Sydney University and CSIROs National Research Collections Australia, all three projects will draw on a pool of experienced citizen scientists to document how Australias unique plants, animals and fungi recover from fire and expand our understanding of invertebrates by building a collection that can be used by taxonomists, ecologists, and researchers.",2021-11,14/12/2021 0:26,26/7/2022 2:07,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,"London, UK",English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3DH327NW\2021 - Australia Citizen scientists to boost bushfire re.pdf,,6 - ALA published; Digivol

The artwork is an artistic data visualisation - evocative while responding to data. The visualisation is part of a new arts practice-based research project for an active looking and witnessing of the gum - as artist-researcher, gardener and custodian for a suburban strip of trees; and as a citizen scientist, to contribute to the Atlas of Living Australia. The Wallangarra White Gum (Eucalyptus scoparia Maiden) is an Australian eucalypt endemic to the Wallangarra area in South East Queensland and bordering Northern NSW. Like many other Australian eucalypts, the White Gum sheds its bark, with vivid displays of layered colour across trunk and bark - especially after rain. Unfortunately, rain is increasingly rare. Also like many other Australian eucalypts, the White Gum is vulnerable (EPBC). Australia has 822 species of eucalypt, with 89 listed as threatened in the Environment Protection & Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999. The artist and work acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, past present and future, most especially the Jukembal people where the Wallangarra gum grows, and the Turrbal and Yuggura people where QUT stands.",21/12/2021,11/1/2022 22:16,11/1/2022 22:47,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\WTVBEGIN\SeevinckWallangarra.MOV; C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\RJS8YJMN\Seevnick_2021_Wallangarra Seeing the White Gum.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

These actions have the ability to facilitate the transmission of species (bio-invasion). Until recently, the number of global introduced species has increased, with negative consequences for environment and the economy. Environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches for detecting the presence of invasive species are currently receiving a lot of interest as a broad approach method in ecological research. As a result, the study used the eDNA technique to compare the quantity and variety of introduced species from the Cnidaria and Porifera Phyla, as well as to characterize their invasiveness status and possible presence in the waters of Jakarta Bay. Based on data from the inside Zone of National Park (ZI) and Outside Zone of National Park (ZO), the biological community composition, richness, and diversity were assessed (ZO). The mBrave workflow generated a total of 14,275 reads from high-throughput sequencing of amplicons from two zones, with 8,917 reads in ZI and 5,358 reads in ZO.  Blackfordia virginica  ,  Cordylophora caspia  , and  Ectopleura crocea  were among the imported species included in the invasive category, with  E. crocea  having the highest abundance and being detected in both zones, with a total of 1300 reads, consisting of 1253 reads in ZI and 47 reads in ZO.

These termite traits are crucial for both ecosystem-level fluxes and trophic webs, with implications for vertebrate species. Despite their ecological importance, the large-scale distribution of termite feeding and nesting traits and the relationship with termite diversity is largely unknown. We investigated whether functional diversity, species richness, and feeding (wood, litter, grass, dung) and nesting trait (aboveground mound, belowground nest, inside tree or outside tree nest) distributions of termites were climatically control. To address this gap, we assembled a continental-scale database of termite traits and occurrence in Australia and modelled termite nesting and feeding traits in response to macroclimate. Functional richness and evenness increased primarily with temperature. Australia showed multiple hotspots of termite diversity with each hotspot showing a distinct guild composition. The large-scale distribution of nesting traits showed that aboveground nesting species were the most common nesting guild in the dry and wet tropics while belowground nesting dominated in seasonally cold arid environments, demonstrating a strong climatic control on nesting strategy. Given their large biomass and many interactions with other species, the macro-ecology of termite traits may be especially important in predicting shifts in other species' distributions at continental and global scales.",17/11/2021,21/12/2021 5:55,21/12/2021 5:57,21/12/2021 5:55,,,,,NA,,Termite trait data from,,NA,NA,,Zenodo,,not specified,"MIT License, Open Access",,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,DOI: 10.5281/ZENODO.5606913,NA,,,4 - ALA acknowledged

Three survey locations were chosen based on the various habitats available: Broughtons Waterhole (Central Block), a track 300m west of Lillimur Track (West Block) and a site north of One Tree Hill Track (East Block). Some moths were photographed at a survey demonstration in agricultural land at the Nhill Basecamp (Nhillbilly Farm) on 25 October 2019. These were included in the full species list. A total list of 185 species was obtained, with 128 identified to species level. This was a relatively low total compared with a set of surveys conducted in 2015 (234 species). Sixteen species demonstrated range extensions, with five new for Victoria. An unidentified Erebidae species is not known to the contributors and may be new. The National Park was a hot-spot for diversity of the Geometridae genus Dichromodes. The low species total may have resulted from the unusually dry conditions. However the surveys produced much new information on moths in the Little Desert and linked them with those observed in other reserves in western Victoria: Neds Corner Station, the Murray-Sunset NP, the Big Desert Wilderness Park and the Grampians NP. A study of the biogeographical gradation of species from the drier north to the wetter south would be worthwhile. Future monitoring is recommended to clarify the effects of drought and warming trends in climate",22/1/2020,27/1/2022 3:35,24/3/2023 1:19,27/1/2020,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Bush Blitz,Australia,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\HDJZVE3D\Powers et al_2020_Little Desert National Park Bush Blitz 21-23rd October 2019.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Some native bee species have been able to adapt to urban environments, foraging and reproducing in these highly modified areas. However, little is known on how the foraging ecology of native bees is affected by urbanised environments, and whether impacts vary among species with different degrees of specialisation for pollen collection. Here, we aim to investigate the responses of native bee foraging behaviour to urbanisation, using DNA metabarcoding to identify the resources within nesting tubes. We targeted oligolectic (specialist) and polylectic (generalist) cavity-nesting bee species in residential gardens and remnant bushland habitats. We were able to identify 40 families, 50 genera, and 23 species of plants, including exotic species. Oligolectic bee species had higher alpha diversity of plant pollen in their nesting tubes in residential gardens compared to bushland habitats, along with significantly different forage composition between the two habitats. This result implies a greater degree of forage flexibility and urban adaptation for oligolectic bee species than previously thought. In contrast, the richness and composition of plant forage in polylectic bee nesting tubes did not vary between the two habitat types. Our results suggest a complex response of cavity-nesting bees to urbanisation and support the need for additional research to understand how the shifts in foraging resources impact overall bee health.",18/1/2022,27/1/2022 7:00,24/3/2023 1:19,27/1/2022 7:00,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,In Review,,not specified,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1256295/v1,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MGIGP3ZA\Fernandes et al_2022_DNA Metabarcoding identifies urban foraging patterns of oligolectic and.pdf,,2 - ALA cited; check if available ⏳; Preliminary report

The 3-year Basin-scale Flow-MER Program aims to demonstrate Basin-scale outcomes of Commonwealth environmental water, support adaptive management; and fulfil CEWH legislative requirements under the Basin Plan. The Species Diversity evaluation focuses on Section 8.05 of the Basin Plan 2012 - Protection and restoration of water-dependent ecosystems. Section 8.05 sets out the objectives relating to the protection and restoration of water-dependent ecosystems in the context of species and populations, threatened taxa, communities and ecosystems listed under state and national legislation, and international agreements - Bonn Convention, China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA), Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA) or Republic of Korea-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA) - and declared Ramsar wetlands. In this report, we focus on evaluating species diversity outcomes not covered in the evaluations of Fish, Vegetation and Ecosystem Diversity. We focus on waterbirds, frogs and turtles along with other waterdependent aquatic vertebrates including reptiles, platypus and rakali with reference to listed threatened species as defined under the Commonwealth Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) (EPBC Act) and relevant state legislation. We also summarise Commonwealth environmental watering actions that influence the hydrology, and thus the species diversity, of Ramsar wetlands within the Murray- Darling Basin. The evaluation addresses the overarching question: What did Commonwealth environmental water contribute to species diversity? This question is addressed through the following 4 sub-components: • What was the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to the diversity and abundance of waterbirds, frogs, turtles, and other water-dependent vertebrates? • What was the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to threatened species and ecological communities? • What was the contribution of Commonwealth environmental to water migratory species listed under international agreements (Bonn Convention, CAMBA, JAMBA or ROKAMBA? • What was the contribution of Commonwealth environmental water to Ramsar wetlands In the Murray-Darling Basin?",2021-08,9/2/2022 1:43,24/3/2023 1:21,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,"Commonwealth Environmental Water Office: Monitoring, Evaluation and Research Program",Commonwealth Environmental Water Office and Flow Monitoring and Research,Australia,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UFFE9ADR\Wassens et al_2021_Basin-scale evaluation of 2019–20 Commonwealth environmental water.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records; ALA Data DOI

Drivers of faunal assemblages are varied, with rainfall, fire and predators considered most influential. The aim of this study was to identify the drivers of fauna persistence following a period of high rainfall and to refine management strategies in the spinifex sand plains of central Australia, with particular reference to the brush-tailed mulgara, Dasycercus blythi. I utilised broad scale fauna monitoring to assess the effect of environmental factors on persistence generally and conducted a detailed assessment of the fine-scale habitat use by D. blythi. I further compared the efficacy of three popular monitoring techniques utilised in the region. This study revealed large mammalian predators were most influential in predicting the occurrence of small mammals and reptile assemblages, whilst rainfall and temperature were most influential for invertebrates. The distribution of D. blythi populations contracted spatially during periods of low rainfall to areas of potential refuge. Fine scale habitat use indicating access to food resources was more influential than selecting areas with low exposure to predators. Infrared cameras sampled the broadest range of species and were the most cost effective over time, whilst sign surveys were most cost effective short term and live trapping essential in detecting several specific species. Overall, these findings inform land managers on the importance of gaining a better understanding of the invertebrate fauna in the region and implementing effective predator control during periods of low rainfall. By targeting management to specific areas of refuge land managers could reduce financial costs whilst maintaining support for key species, such as D. blythi. Land managers would further benefit from implementing a greater variety of monitoring techniques to maximise the effectiveness of monitoring both financially and statistically.",2017,10/2/2022 1:39,10/2/2022 2:20,10/2/2022 1:39,,266,,,NA,,Fauna Assemblages of the Spinifex Sand Plains in Central Australia,,NA,NA,,Charles Darwin University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.25913/5eba3ae030d9b ISBN: 9798759918165,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DTLCIMXW\Molyneux_2017_Fauna Assemblages of the Spinifex Sand Plains in Central Australia.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records

It explores three specific sociotechnical assemblages, defined as heterogeneous sets of social and technical resources functioning together for various purposes. The types of language work that emerged were the role of language in practices of documentation, pedagogy and identity-making. The three projects under consideration respond to different motivations: the Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages is a digital archive of endangered literature in languages of the Northern Territory, motivated by a concern for the fate of materials produced in bilingual education programs in remote schools. The Digital Language Shell is a resource for developing and mobilising curricula in Indigenous languages and cultures, motivated by a need for a low-cost and low-tech template for sharing content under Indigenous authority. The Bininj Kunwok online course is a specific implementation of the Digital Language Shell, teaching an Indigenous language of West Arnhem land in a university context. Each project was created by the author working collaboratively with different teams, to support various types of language work. This PhD by publication offers a set of seven academic papers, each focusing on different aspects of the projects, and written for distinct audiences. The methods entailed iterative inquiry, as I reflected on my work as project manager in developing these digital resources, first addressing the technical and practical considerations, then through the lenses of various academic disciplines, and finally in a meta-analysis of the various heterogeneous elements that make up the research. The thesis emerges as an assemblage of heterogeneities - projects, papers, concepts, academic references, and auto-ethnographic stories - that is in itself a sociotechnical assemblage.",2020,10/2/2022 5:11,10/2/2022 5:12,10/2/2022 5:11,,406,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Charles Darwin University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.25913/rm9p-h895 ISBN: 9798759918097,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\LHNMXNFU\Bow_2020_Entanglements of Digital Technologies and Indigenous Language Work in the.pdf,,Biocollect; 4 - ALA acknowledged; IEK; TracksApp

Traditional Owners (TOs) and Ranger groups have achieved substantial support through government and non-government funding programs. As these programs mature, ILSM practitioners and their collaborators are grappling with how to evaluate success, a requirement necessary for ILSM to satisfy investment. To date, there has been little work describing the experience of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) from Indigenous perspectives. This thesis advances the discussion by providing accounts of how TOs and Rangers from two ILSM groups - in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in South Australia and at Ngukurr in the Northern Territory - are responding to the evaluation of their ILSM programs and collaborations. Both people-places have government-funded Ranger groups, Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs), and non-government funded initiatives, each with requisite reporting requirements. The thesis has used background research, and collaborative investigations with TOs and Rangers to observe the activities undertaken and assess what was being achieved from their perspective. This work clarifies the problem - how to do M&E and strengthen Indigenous governance of Country without extending neoliberal governmentality. While there are tensions between funders, TOs and Rangers, the results show Indigenous agency in expressing priorities in ILSM programs, and through determining the activities and timing of work undertaken. TOs and Rangers gave a high priority to being on Country, performing ceremony, recounting and singing the Tjukurpa (APY Lands) or Drimin (Ngukurr), and maintaining language as integral components of ILSM - in addition to the more conservation-focused activities such as weed or feral animal control. However, the absence of local language words encompassing monitoring, management or success revealed that conventional M&E reporting may continue the disempowering colonial processes that ILSM aspires to reverse. Social, cultural, and environmental objectives are also not easily defined, for TOs, Rangers, or non-Indigenous funders. Nevertheless, Indigenous-focused M&E processes can provide further 'proof of concept' for Ranger and IPA programs, which have grown exponentially in recent decades. The research indicates that improved communication and understanding about the holistic objectives of ILSM, supported by collaborative governance of ISLM programs, could contribute to the development of fit-for-purpose M&E processes, which support and respect Indigenous evaluative methods and tools.",2019,10/2/2022 4:37,10/2/2022 4:57,10/2/2022 4:37,,484,,,NA,,Looking After Country,,NA,NA,,Charles Darwin University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.25913/5eb3947dbadea ISBN: 9798759918684,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\T42VWTG8\Macdonald_2019_Looking After Country.pdf,,4 - ALA acknowledged; IEK

Open Educational Practice with Indigenous Workforce Development and Learners,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2606866503/abstract/1863972EAC246ECPQ/1,"Public institutions are consistently challenged to appropriately include diverse populations, knowledges and cultures. Public policy sectors can reconcile some of these challenges and support increasingly complex social needs through creative technology design and use. Therefore, improving how technologies facilitate information and knowledge sharing can help us navigate our complex world and better include and learn from excluded peoples and knowledges. This study examined four online resources in multidisciplinary contexts and how they performed as open education practices (OEP). Learners, it can be argued, are the focus of the open movement. This study therefore interrogates the different knowledge practices the resources encourage and how they count towards defining a functionally successful 'openness' to learners' knowledge background. I focused on Indigenous public policy resources and explored ways institutions can develop better relationships with learners and knowledge holders and how they value knowledges via OEP. In culturally distinct situations where knowledge is shared differently, western notions of openness require adapting. The focus and title of this study is therefore to examine what OEP are open for mand to whom. My research questions were: How do we make OEP more functionally successful for diverse learners? What is 'open' about these resources and practices? How are OEP used in these contexts? What are successful outcomes for these OEP, who defines this and what matters? I examined how the resources met three sets of criteria to understand how they acknowledged and represented knowledges. The study developed several principles for OEP guided by three broad theory statements prior to program design: the ways we use languages needs deeper understanding; contextualising resources connects knowledge management to local realities on multiple levels; and particular ways to use technology can support knowledge sovereignty. By starting with theory statements such as these, we can continue improving engagement between knowledge systems, cultures and sectors via OEP.",2019,10/2/2022 4:41,10/2/2022 4:57,10/2/2022 4:41,,388,,,NA,,Open for Whom?,,NA,NA,,Charles Darwin University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.25913/5ed849026cebd ISBN: 9798759917007,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\GMF542JY\Funk_2019_Open for Whom.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed; IEK

Changed fire regimes have been proposed as one of the prominent causes of decline in this species and many other granivores. The contemporary fire regime consisting of severe, frequent and extensive fire is implicated in a reduction of grass species abundance and diversity, and possibly food availability to granivores throughout the tropical savannas of northern Australia. Gouldian finches are particularly affected due to their restricted diet, which consists almost solely of annual Sorghum grass seed throughout the dry season and breeding season. This thesis has examined the effect of fire on the nutritional quality and quantity of annual grass Sorghum stipoideum seeds as a possible mechanism underpinning breeding site choice in response to fire by Gouldian finches. Gouldian finch breeding sites were monitored in the north east Kimberley region of Western Australia. Breeding site choice in response to fire was determined using nest-box occupancy and fire history at each site. The effect of fire on Sorghum seed phenology, abundance and nutritional quality were investigated. The research found that Gouldian finches choose breeding sites that were recently but infrequently burnt, and the initiation of breeding was timed with the availability of Sorghum seed locally. Further, site selection by the finches was associated with the higher availability and nutritional quality of the Sorghum seeds. Sorghum seeds were most abundant and nutritious in areas that have been recently, but infrequently burnt, which parallels the findings pertaining to breeding site choice. Research from this thesis illustrates the mechanisms by which altered fire regime may be impacting upon the Gouldian finches. This information will assist by informing fire management in areas with known Gouldian finch breeding populations.",2017,10/2/2022 1:56,10/2/2022 2:20,10/2/2022 1:56,,194,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Charles Darwin University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.25913/5ea66e03dbeeb ISBN: 9798759916406,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\I5F9UQ7F\Weier_2017_Impacts of Fire on Sorghum Stipoideum and Subsequent Influence upon Breeding in.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records

Wolbachia's success in infecting an enormous number of arthropod species is attributed to two features: the range of phenotypes they induce in their hosts, and their ability to switch between host species. Whilst much progress has been made in elucidating their induced phenotypes, our understanding of Wolbachia host shifting is still very limited: we lack answers to even fundamental questions concerning Wolbachia's routes of transfer and the importance of factors influencing host shifts. Here, we investigate the diversity and host-shift patterns of Wolbachia in scale insects, a group of arthropods with intimate associations with other insects that make them well-suited to studying host shifts. Using Illumina pooled amplicon sequencing of Wolbachia-infected scale insects and their direct associates we determined the identity of all Wolbachia strains. We then fitted a Generalised Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) to our data to estimate the influence of host phylogeny and the geographic distribution on Wolbachia strain sharing among scale insect species. The model predicts no significant contribution of host geography but strong effects of host phylogeny, with high rates of Wolbachia sharing among closely related species and a sudden drop-off in sharing with increasing phylogenetic distance. We also detected the same Wolbachia strain in scale insects and several intimately associated species (ants, wasps, beetles, and flies). This indicates putative host shifts and potential routes of transfers via these associates and highlights the importance of ecological connectivity in Wolbachia host-shifting.",21/2/2022,28/2/2022 1:14,24/3/2023 1:23,28/2/2022 1:14,,,,,NA,,Host phylogeny and ecological associations best explain Wolbachia host shifts in scale insects Running title,,NA,NA,,Preprints,,not specified,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.22541/au.164544146.67062526/v1,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\D774KC3P\Sanaei et al_2022_Host phylogeny and ecological associations best explain Wolbachia host shifts.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Tweetable 🕊️; Animals

These declines have been variously attributed to either disruption of resource availability or increased predation pressure from invasive species. The aims of my study were to identify the factors that influence the distribution, abundance and ecology of an arboreal marsupial, the savanna glider (Petaurus ariel) in the tropical savannas of northern Australia; including whether this species is in decline. My study forms the first targeted ecological research on this species, which was formerly considered a subspecies of the sugar glider, P. breviceps. My research reveals significant variation in the abundance and ecology of P. ariel across its geographic range within the tropical savannas. I found that the dramatic north-south climatic gradient within northern Australia has an overarching influence on the distribution, abundance, density, home range size and fine-scale habitat use of P. ariel. Interestingly, I found a 50% increase in P. ariel body mass and a ten-fold increase in P. ariel home range size in areas of low resource availability. The variable ecology of P. ariel has enabled the species to adapt to varied environmental conditions, including areas of naturally low resource availability at the southern edge of the species' distribution. Importantly, my research shows evidence of a 35% decline in the geographic distribution of P. ariel, primarily in the southern end of its geographic range; emphasising the need to understand fundamental aspects of the species' ecology for future conservation efforts. Overall, my findings highlight the influence of variation in resource availability on an arboreal marsupial in the tropical savannas of northern Australia. My thesis contributes to our understanding of the drivers of the ecology of this, and other, arboreal mammal species inhabiting the region, and helps explain underlying patterns of decline.",2018,22/2/2022 6:01,22/2/2022 6:19,22/2/2022 6:01,,222,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Charles Darwin University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.25913/5ea9028a3a782 ISBN: 9798759917410,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\9TIVSWVG\Stobo-Wilson_2018_Ecology of the Savanna Glider (Petaurus Ariel) in Tropical Northern Australia.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records; Animals

Conserving and improving landscape connectivity is important to offset those threats, yet its assessment for invertebrates is lacking. In this study, we evaluated the functional connectivity between protected areas in Australia for 59 butterfly species, under present conditions and different future scenarios (for 2050 and 2090) of land-use, land-cover, and climate change. Using circuit-theory analysis, we found that functional connectivity under present conditions varies widely between species, even when their estimated geographical ranges are similar. Under future scenarios, functional connectivity is predicted to decrease overall, with negative changes worsening from 2050 to 2090, although a few species are positive exceptions. We have made our results available as spatial datasets to allow comparisons with taxa from other studies and can be used to identify priority areas for conservation in terms of establishing ecological corridors or stepping-stone habitat patches. Our study highlights the importance of considering pollinating invertebrates when seeking holistic conservation and restoration of a landscape's functional connectivity, underscoring the need to expand and promote protected areas to facilitate functional connectivity under future scenarios of global change.

A phylogenetic analysis of the internal relationships in Signiphoridae, a discussion of its supra-specific classification based on DNA sequences of the 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and COI genes, and taxonomic studies on the genera Clytina, Thysanus and Chartocerus are presented. In the phylogenetic analyses, all genera except Clytina were recovered as monophyletic. The classification into subfamilies was not supported. Out of the four currently recognized species groups in Signiphora, only the Signiphora flavopalliata species group was supported. The taxonomic work was conducted using advanced digital imaging, content management systems, having in sight the online delivery of taxonomic information. The evolution of changes in the taxonomic workflow and dissemination of results are reviewed and discussed in light of current bioinformatics. The species of Thysanus and Clytina are revised and redescribed, including documentation of type material. Four new species of Thysanus and one of Clytina are described. The taxonomy of Chartocerus is reviewed, including redescriptions of 25 out of 33 currently valid species, most based on type or topotypical material.",2014-12,15/2/2022 3:57,24/3/2023 3:09,15/2/2022 3:57,,294,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Texas A&M University,United States -- Texas,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9781321972603,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3PNHW8AF\Dal Molin_Web-integrated taxonomy and systematics of the parasitic wasp family.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

YJUGNPZP,preprint,2022,"Carlin, Thomas; Bufford, Jennifer L.; Hulme, Philip E.; Godsoe, William K.",Global assessment of three Rumex species reveals inconsistent climatic niche shifts across introduced ranges,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1358439/v1,"Climatic niche shifts occur when species occupy different climates in the introduced range than in their native range. Climatic niche shifts are known to occur across a range of taxa, however we do not currently understand whether climatic niche shifts can consistently be predicted across multiple introduced ranges. Using three congeneric weed species, we investigate whether climatic niche shifts in one introduced range are consistent in other ranges where the species has been introduced. We compared the climatic conditions occupied by  Rumex conglomeratus  ,  R. crispus  , and  R. obtusifolius  between their native range (Eurasia) and three different introduced ranges (North America, Australia, New Zealand). We considered metrics of niche overlap, expansion, unfilling, pioneering, and similarity to determine whether climatic niche shifts were consistent across ranges and congeners. We found that the presence and direction of climatic niche shifts was inconsistent between introduced ranges for each species. Within an introduced range, however, niche shifts were qualitatively similar among species. North America and New Zealand experienced diverging niche expansion into drier and wetter climates respectively, whilst the niche was conserved in Australia. This work highlights how unique characteristics of an introduced range and local introduction history can drive different niche shifts, and that comparisons between only the native and one introduced range may misrepresent a species' capacity for niche shifts. However, predictions of climatic niche shifts could be improved by comparing related species in the introduced range rather than relying on the occupied environments of the native range.",15/3/2022,15/3/2022 6:48,24/3/2023 2:03,15/3/2022 6:48,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,,not specified,,,,,Research Square,,DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1358439/v1 ISSN: 2693-5015 Type: article,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DDU8HMGT\Carlin et al_2022_Global assessment of three Rumex species reveals inconsistent climatic niche.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Modelling; Plants

V37NSZLI,report,2022,"Kruger, H.; Ticehurst, J.; Van der Seemo, A.",Making general surveillance programs work - Lessons from nine case studies,,,,,https://doi.org/10.25814/j4wh-1639,"General surveillance programs refer to programs that engage people from all walks of life in monitoring and reporting pests, weeds and diseases. General surveillance programs are expected to make an increasing contribution to Australia's and New Zealand's biosecurity surveillance needs. It is important that general surveillance programs are appropriately designed, implemented and monitored to ensure that they deliver intended outcomes in ways that are cost-effective and sustainable. General surveillance programs are extensive and complex undertakings with various components and functions that need to work in harmony to ensure they deliver as intended. Change in one part can have unintended consequences for other parts that may affect the overall program performance. The Making General Surveillance Work project explored general surveillance programs through a systems thinking lens to deepen understanding about their different components (and the functions they contribute to) as well as the interactions between them. It started with a literature review follow by the development of General Surveillance Program Guidelines (the Guidelines) that were developed to support the design, implementation and monitoring of general surveillance programs. This report provides the evidence base for the Guidelines and explores nine diverse case studies of general surveillance programs covering weeds, plant health, marine biosecurity and animal health. Some programs are open to anyone to participate, whereas others target people in certain roles (such as private veterinarians) or organisations (such as ports) to contribute surveillance data. Some programs are unstructured, encouraging reports of almost any unusual sighting of organisms or symptoms at any time. Other programs are more structured, with requirements on when and where surveillance activities are undertaken, or for a limited number of target species. Data were obtained through desktops reviews; 93 semi-structured interviews with key informants representing different parts of the general surveillance programs; eight focus groups; and online surveys with the notifiers of five case studies. The key components of general surveillance programs investigated are the actors involved, their relationships, infrastructure (including physical elements and resources), institutions (formal, semi-formal and informal rules) and species and their environment. Key interactions identified included areas that affect cost-effectiveness and the ability of programs to meet the intended outcomes.",2022,19/4/2022 4:21,24/3/2023 2:09,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences,"Canberra, Australia",not specified,,Technical Report,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\NZ4W8W2J\Kruger et al_2022_Making general surveillance programs work – Lessons from nine case studies.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed; AVH

Since insect pest diseases knock down the growth and production of agricultural resources, there is a need to vanish the insects through pesticides after their accurate recognition. Fast and effective algorithms for insect pest recognition are now possible on account of improvements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI). The deep transfer learning models (DTLMs) based insect pest recognition system is proposed in this paper. Two deep transfer learning models i.e., InceptionV3 and VGG19 are applied in this work. Pre-processing is used to locate areas containing the most relevant features. The IP102 dataset launched in 2019 is used in this research and a comparison is carried out to check the performance of the applied models.

It also provides easy access to key recommendations on shelterbelt orientation, planting density, location, species selection and maintenance to adapt to climate change, increase agricultural production, protect built assets and enhance biodiversity. Shelterbelts have been used for decades to reduce the impacts of extreme weather conditions across agricultural areas and to favourably change local climatic conditions to optimise crop and animal production. Strong winds, together with drought, flood and extremes of temperature are among the major natural causes of crop and animal production losses and these impacts are predicted to increase in severity under climate change. Most shelterbelts in southern Australia were established to reduce crop and livestock exposure to the extremes of wind and temperature created after the original landscape was cleared. In 2019 the Bunyip Fire Complex severely impacted the townships of Bunyip North, Tynong North, Garfield North and Tonimbuk. Following the 2019 bushfires, it is timely that the design of shelterbelts is revisited to include climate change considerations. The Guidelines demonstrate that there are significant benefits to be gained from planting shelterbelts under climate change and provides details on: • The benefits of planting shelterbelts. • How to plan and design shelterbelts that will mitigate climate change impacts. • How to select species that will survive future climatic conditions, • Site planning and preparation. • Shelterbelt management. • Example design principles to assist whole of farm planning.",7/2/2022,28/3/2022 23:45,24/3/2023 2:04,29/3/2022,46,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Eco Logical Australia,Australia,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\9M9TY25E\Jones et al_2022_Shelterbelt Design Guidelines for Climate Change - Cardinia Shire Council.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed; Plants

It is now possible to detect and quantify DNA or RNA of target species or even map the whole species community in environmental samples of water, sediment, soil, air or assemblages of whole organisms. Moreover, the costs of high-throughput sequencing and other advanced molecular methods have decreased and methodological pipelines from sampling to data analysis developed sufficiently to allow large-scale, routine application of the new methods in environmental monitoring. This presents a huge opportunity to improve the coverage, accuracy and cost-efficiency of monitoring, enabling a much more complete picture of biodiversity and the state of the environment and their trends. As the new European Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and other international policies to halt biodiversity loss and the degradation of habitats are translated into concrete measures, the quality of the monitoring data will play a crucial role in determining their success or failure. In this roadmap commissioned by the Finnish Ministry of the Environment, we assess the state-ofthe-art in molecular monitoring methods in Finland within the international context, identify challenges and development areas that remain to be addressed and propose an action plan for promoting the coordinated implementation of molecular methods in national monitoring programs. Apart from the most recent scientific literature, our analysis is based on survey results, direct enquiries and interviews. Participation of the national community of experts from different sectors was enabled and invited at several stages of the roadmap preparation. Internationally, molecular monitoring methods are being actively developed and are routinely implemented in monitoring across different taxa and ecosystems. In Finland, molecular monitoring methods have been tested and piloted by all major institutions responsible for environmental monitoring, and the methods are already applied routinely in the monitoring of individual game species such as the wolf and European and Canadian beaver. However, other areas such as the monitoring of biodiversity, threatened species, non-mammalian invasive species or emerging plant or animal pests remain less developed, and national efforts and expertise are scattered across different organizations. Funding and know-how are perceived as the most important factors limiting molecular monitoring method implementation. We estimate that extensive, routine implementation of a wide range of molecular monitoring methods is conceivable in Finland before 2030. As the primary development areas for reaching this goal, we identify (i) international coordination and standard development, (ii) networking across sectors, (iii) education, (iv) infrastructure, (v) reference sequence libraries and the mapping of whole genomes, and (vi) modelling and analysis tool development. For concrete actions in 2022-2025, we propose (1) a cross-governmental funding instrument, (2) a permanent working group responsible for national and international coordination, (3) a national network and (4) an online platform to enhance interaction and knowledge transfer, as well as (5) a national data management system with collectively agreed data and metadata formats and standards.",2022,2/5/2022 1:43,24/3/2023 3:54,,74,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Finnish Environment Institute,"Helsinki, Finland",English,,,,,Zotero,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\5HYHIP24\Norros et al. - Roadmap for implementing environmental DNA (eDNA) .pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

I have studied the structure and function of these terrestrial microbial communities to better understand how these communities form, what influences their structure and functions, how the microbes within those communities interact with each other and the macroscopic world. In particular, I have focused on the factors influencing the functional potential of these communities. First, I show that the structure of boreal moss-associated microbial communities is primarily driven by the host species and that boreal mosses harbor large amounts of microbial diversity. In this diverse consortia are a novel carbon-fixing anoxygenic phototrophs from the lineage WPS-2 (Eremiobacterota), whose genome I assembled, and a wide-array of putative nitrogen-fixers from lineages other than the well-studied cyanobacteria that are typically studied in association with mosses. Second I show that during primary succession, temperature and precipitation are more important for structuring the functional attributes of microbial communities than the taxonomic or phylogenetic composition of those communities, and identify genes that respond to differences in temperature and precipitation during primary succession. Finally, I demonstrate that genes of unknown function in soils can be characterized by using associated environmental data and that the most dominant (abundant and ubiquitous) genes of unknown function in soils are linked to mobile genetic elements. Together these studies shed light onto the forces that shape microbial community assembly in terrestrial environments and how host and environmental factors influence the functional potential of these communities.",2021,3/5/2022 13:28,3/5/2022 13:29,3/5/2022 13:28,,177,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Colorado at Boulder,United States -- Colorado,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798738627330,NA,,,check if available ⏳

ERAs are conducted by the Department as part of its Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management framework. Outputs of this ERA will inform future versions of the Harvest Strategy for the Resource. Additionally, this ERA is a requirement of the Wildlife Trade Operation approval for the Marine Aquarium Fish Managed Fishery. The ERA considered the potential ecological impacts of the Marine Aquarium Fish Managed Fishery, which is the only commercial fishery that targets the Resource, and other extractive sectors that access the Resource. The ERA evaluated the impact of fishing on retained species, threatened, endangered, and protected species, habitats and the broader environment. A broad range of stakeholders were invited to the ERA workshop, including representatives of the commercial and recreational fishing sectors, Commonwealth, state and local government agencies, James Cook University, and relevant conservation organisations (see Appendix C). Risk scores were determined based on available research information and expert knowledge on species, fishing activities, fishery regulations and management. This assessment conforms to the AS/NZS ISO 31000 risk management standard and the methodology adopted by the Department, which relies on a likelihood-consequence analysis for estimating risk. Forty-three ecological components were scored for risk. The majority (39) of ecological components were evaluated as low or negligible risks, which do not require any specific control measures. There were four medium risks, which were assessed as acceptable under the current monitoring and control measures already in place. The ERA did not yield any high risks.

The wetland provides ecological services to a range of biota, including waterbirds and fish, which are supported at critical stages of their life-histories. Knowledge of the key food resources and diet compositions of waterbirds and less abundant fishes in the Coorong is limited, yet this information is critical for understanding trophic dynamics. The South Australian Government's Healthy Coorong, Healthy Basin (HCHB) program's Trials and Investigations (T&I) project includes a food web investigations component (Component 3). This component aims to develop an integrated quantitative food web model for the Coorong, using empirical investigations, that can predict trophic responses to various conditions including management actions. In this study, we aimed to fill critical dietary knowledge gaps by identifying the major food resources and their relative contribution to the diets of a small-bodied, resident prey fish (lagoon goby Tasmanogobius lasti) and five important waterbird species in the Coorong. The five waterbird species were comprised of two migratory shorebirds (sharp-tailed sandpiper Calidris acuminata and red-necked stint C. ruficollis), one nonmigratory shorebird (red-capped plover Charadrius ruficapillus) and two non-migratory waterfowl (chestnut teal Anas castanea and grey teal Anas gracilis). The diets of these species were explored using traditional gut content analysis (fish) and DNA metabarcoding of scats (waterbirds). For DNA metabarcoding, universal primers targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and protein-coding chloroplast gene (rbcL) were used to amplify the DNA of animal (metazoan) and vegetation (plants and algae, 'plant' herein) food species, respectively, because the investigated waterbird species were considered to be omnivorous (i.e. feed on both animals and plants). Fresh scats were collected opportunistically from each waterbird species, with species-specific blocking primers designed and applied in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mix to reduce amplification of predator DNA for the COI gene assay. Two reference library databases of COI (animal) and rbcL (plant) sequences were also generated from potential prey samples collected from key foraging grounds in the Coorong to help resolve unknown taxonomic identifications.",2022,31/5/2022 6:23,24/3/2023 2:13,31/5/2021,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,Technical Report Series,Goyder Institute for Water Research,Australia,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\H9RDEZHM\Giatas et al. - 2022 - Primary food resources for key waterbirds and bent.pdf,,2 - ALA cited; Animals

LZANCP4X,thesis,2021,"Weinstein, Alyssa M.",Pollination Ecology of Australian Sexually Deceptive Orchids with Contrasting Patterns of Pollinator Exploitation,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2665127530/abstract/E74CDEA8739D49FCPQ/1,"Sexual deception, entailing the pollination of flowers through mimicry of female insects, is one of the most remarkable pollination strategies to have evolved. This thesis explores two Australian sexually deceptive orchid systems with contrasting patterns of pollinator exploitation. The first three chapters focus on the orchid genus Cryptostylis, a system with a unique case of pollinator sharing - five Australian species, four of which are largely sympatric, all deceive the same male ichneumonid wasp pollinator Lissopimpla excelsa. In Chapter One (published in Biological Journal of the Linnaean Society), mark-recapture experiments were used to investigate the consequences of ichneumonid pollination on pollen movement in C. ovata. A high pollinator revisitation rate indicated some potential for self-pollination. In Chapter Two, reproductive barriers contributing to the absence of hybrids between Cryptostylis species were investigated. Pre-pollination barriers, assessed in field experiments, did not prevent hybridisation. Hand cross-pollinations conducted among the four common Cryptostylis species in a greenhouse all produced fruits, however seed mass and the percentage of formed embryos were reduced in hybrids. Major differences in ploidy and chromosome number likely explain this post-pollination fitness reduction. Two species of Cryptostylis were found to be self-incompatible, marking the first case of self-incompatibility in the Diurideae. The unique reproductive biology of Australian Cryptostylis, encompassing pollinator sharing, self-incompatibility, and post-pollination reproductive isolation driven by large ploidy differences, may indicate that its mode of diversification may differ greatly to those in other sexually deceptive genera. Chapter Three presents the first phylogeny to encompass both Australian and Asiatic Cryptostylis. An Australian origin of Cryptostylis is supported, with a likely single subsequent dispersal event to Asia. Ploidy variation and geographic barriers appear to have played a role in diversification across Cryptostylis. In Chapter Four, the potential presence of pollination ecotypes in the sexually deceptive Drakaea livida was tested for. Patterns of chemical diversity and pollinator availability across the distribution of the species were investigated. Pollinator choice trials revealed the presence of three discrete ecotypes each attracting its own pollinator species. Patterns of pollinator availability did not correlate with ecotype distribution. Each ecotype possessed a significantly different floral volatile composition. Using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), the presence-absence of a subset of taxonomically informative compounds could be used to accurately predict the ecotype of a flower. Different classes of electrophysiologically active compounds were present in different ecotypes. These marked differences in chemical composition between the ecotypes suggest either a long time since their divergence and may hint at a scenario of convergent evolution of floral morphology. In Chapter Five, the ecotype geographic ranges and methods of identifying the ecotypes were investigated. Species distribution modelling predicted each ecotype to have a different core range. Two ecotypes were widespread, while one had a limited distribution within extensively cleared agricultural land, raising conservation concerns. PLS-DA correctly identified the ecotype of a flower when labella extracts were made from pollinated flowers, thereby providing a non-destructive identification technique. The pollinator specificity, morphology, floral chemistry, and ranges of the ecotypes supported them as Evolutionary Significant Units. In conclusion, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of pollination by sexual deception may vary extensively between plant taxa in accordance with their different patterns of pollinator exploitation. The taxonomy, species richness of the pollinator group, and the plant species to pollinator species ratio all influence the evolution and diversification of sexually deceptive orchids.",2021,24/5/2022 4:54,24/5/2022 11:06,24/5/2022 4:54,,237,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798426881938,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\3FUV8MTW\Weinstein_2021_Pollination Ecology of Australian Sexually Deceptive Orchids with Contrasting.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Plants

However, it is not always successful. Examining historical records of biocontrol efforts would be an alternative approach to understand biocontrol agent and target weed traits correlations with success. The second chapter of this thesis is a review examining life history traits of biocontrol agent and target weed life history traits associated with biocontrol establishment and impact using the 5th edition of 'Biological Control of Weeds: A World Catalogue of Agents and their Target Weeds' and other reports of biological control agents and target weed traits. This analysis showed that both biocontrol agent and target weed life history traits influenced the success of biological control programs, with the traits of agents more important than those of the weed. The analysis is intended to inform biological control practitioners of the importance agent and weed life history traits for establishment and successful control of weeds. Chapter 2 also revealed that biocontrol candidate agents are typically exposed to test plant species grown in nutrient-rich homogenous soil, but this could influence the susceptibility of herbivory that are adapted to special soil types, for example nutrient-poor metal-rich serpentine soil. Therefore, in the third chapter of this thesis, I tested these hypotheses in our system, the invasive weed, Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaeae), several nontarget species related to this weed and a biological control candidate, the stem and petiole gall-forming weevil Ceutorhynchus cardariae Korotyeav (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Results showed that native serpentine soil influenced C. cardariae herbivory. Our data show that native species confamilial with the target restricted to specialized soil types may be at less risk of herbivore attack than predicted based on tests conducted in horticultural soil.",2022,14/6/2022 3:41,18/7/2022 3:14,14/6/2022 3:41,,155,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Idaho,United States -- Idaho,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,M.S.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798438792420,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\HS27WF27\Panta_2022_Retrospective Analysis of Worldwide Biocontrol Project Success and Study of.pdf,,2 - ALA cited; Profiles

While there are efforts in the marine community and crowd-sourcing to report the occurrence of marine species, not enough projects explore the prediction of where such animals may be. This dissertation analyzes the state of the art in species distribution model ing (SDM) systems, capable of reporting and predicting marine biodiversity. The proposal implements the algorithms for predicting species through publicly avail able repositories of data, provides means to ease the upload and management of occurrence points as well as methods for prediction analysis. A web-based user interface is proposed using Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) as an automated alerting mechanism towards ecological awareness. Performed user studies evaluate marine biodiversity concerns from fisherman and whale-watching sea-vessels, assessing attitudes, threats, values, and motiva tion of both samples. Further, biologists and experts on ENMs will evaluate the workflow and interface, reviewing the proposal's potential to enable ecologists to create solutions for their custom problems using simple protocols without the need for any third-party entities and extensive knowledge in programming.

ZUTWRDR9,thesis,2019,"Haerani, Haerani",Remote Sensing of Peanut Cropping Areas and Modelling of their Future Geographic Distribution and Disease Risks,,,,,https://eprints.usq.edu.au/39929/,"Peanut or groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L), one of the most important oil seed crops, faces several challenges due to climate change. The unfavourable climate in Australia, as a result of high climate variability, could easily affect peanut production. For example, the incidence of drought stress will increase the likelihood of one of the major problems in the peanut industry, i.e. aflatoxin. In addition, if the climate changes as projected, shifts in geographic distribution of peanut crops and the associated diseases are inevitable. In view of these concerns, this study set the following objectives: 1) to assess the effectiveness of PROBA-V imagery in mapping peanut crops; 2) to study the effects of climate change on the future geographic distribution of peanut crops in Australia; and 3) to examine the effects of climate change on the future distribution of aflatoxin in peanut crops, and to locate high risk areas of aflatoxin in the future areas of peanut crop production. In this study, the area of peanut crop mapping was the South Burnett region in Queensland, while the area of future geographic distribution of peanut crops and aflatoxin covered the entire continent of Australia. To address the first objective, the peanut crop areas were mapped using timeseries PROBA-V NDVI by stacking time-series imagery and generating the phenological parameter imagery. Three classification algorithms were used: maximum likelihood classification (MLC), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and minimum distance classification (Min). The results reveal that the overall accuracy of mapping using time-series imagery outweighed phenological parameter imagery, although both datasets performed very well in mapping peanut crops. MLC application in the time-series imagery dataset produced the best result, i.e. overall accuracy of 92.75%, with producer and user accuracy of each class ≥ 78.79%. Specifically for peanut crops, all the algorithms tested produced satisfactory results (≥75.95% of producer and user accuracy), except for the producer accuracy of Min algorithm. Overall, PROBA-V imagery can provide satisfactory results in mapping peanut crops in the study area. For the second objective, the effects of climate change in the potential future geographic distribution of peanut crops in Australia for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100 were studied using the CLIMEX program (a Species Distribution Model) under Global Climate Models (GCMs) of CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H. The results show an increase in unsuitable areas for peanut cultivation in Australia throughout the projection years for the two GCMs. However, the CSIRO-Mk3 projection of unsuitable areas for 2100 was higher (76% of Australian land) than MIROC-H projection (48% of Australian land). Both GCMs agreed that some current peanut cultivation areas will become unsuitable in the future, while only limited areas will still remain suitable for peanut cultivation. The present study confirms the effects of climate change on the suitability of peanut growing areas in the future. In the third objective, the impacts of climate change on future aflatoxin distribution in Australia and the high risk areas of aflatoxin incidence in the projected future distribution of peanut crops were examined. The projected future distribution of aflatoxin for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100 was also modelled using CLIMEX under CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H GCMs. The results demonstrated that only a small portion of the Australian continent will be optimal/suitable for aflatoxin persistence, due to the incidence of heat and dry stresses. The map overlay results between the future projections of aflatoxin and peanut crops resulted in small areas of low aflatoxin risk in the future projected areas of peanut crops. It is projected that most of the current peanut cultivation areas will have a high aflatoxin risk, while others will no longer be favourable for peanut cultivation in the future. This study has clearly demonstrated the ability of PROBA-V satellite imagery in mapping peanut crops. It has also demonstrated that climate change incidence will affect the suitability areas of future geographical distribution of peanut crops and the associated aflatoxin disease. This study provides strategic information on current peanut growing areas, future suitable areas for peanut crops in Australia, and future high risk areas of aflatoxin incidence. This information will provide valuable contributions to the long-term planning of peanut cultivation in the country.",2019,6/7/2022 4:47,6/7/2022 5:42,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Southern Queensland,,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\Y3K2Q8H8\Haerani_2019_Remote Sensing of Peanut Cropping Areas and Modelling of their Future.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map

Landscape simplification is considered a major threat to bee and wasp conservation in the tropics, but reliable population data is lacking. Pressures on bees and wasps in simplified landscapes may be reduced by increasing natural vegetation or resource diversity. Little is known, however, about the long-term resource requirements of bee colonies and even less is known about the specific resource requirements of solitary bee and wasp species, particularly in the tropics. This thesis describes community dynamics and resource use for tropical bee and wasp taxa in natural (forests) and simplified (orchard) landscapes using DNA metabarcoding. My research aims were to 1) compare long-term seasonal variability in pollen resources utilised by a social stingless bee (Tetragonula carbonaria) in natural and simplified landscapes (Chapter 2); 2) determine how landscape simplification and seasonal variability influence trap-nesting bee and wasp communities in the subtropics (Chapter 3); and 3) identify and compare key plant sources of brood provisions and nest materials for cavity-nesting solitary bees in natural and simplified landscapes using DNA metabarcoding (Chapter 4).",2022,6/7/2022 5:27,6/7/2022 5:41,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of the Sunshine Coast,,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\274L57K7\Wilson_Effects of landscape simplification on the ecology of Australian native bees.pdf,,2 - ALA cited
ZINZJZYR,thesis,2022,"Adeleye, Matthew A.","Palaeoecology of Southeast Australian Ecosystems, with a Focus on the Bass Strait Area: Implications for Ecosystem Management",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2689309753/abstract/21057FC5C0CD4E9EPQ/1,"Global change poses a major threat to ecosystems and biodiversity. This is particularly evident in southeast Australia, where never-before-seen wildfires are associated with ecosystem destruction, as well as loss of wildlife, human lives and infrastructures. In order to tackle these challenges, there is a need for better understanding of long-term ecosystem changes in the region. This understanding will help in building robust knowledge baselines for management and restoration goals. The Bass Strait islands (BSI) provide a rare opportunity to investigate the long-term roles of climate and human land use in driving ecosystem and fire regime changes, due to their unique history of human occupation, which contrasts with surrounding southeast Australian regions. The BSI saw declining populations at the same time as population intensification occurred in southeast (SE) Australia in the mid-late Holocene. The BSI can thus be regarded as rare natural laboratories where climatic and anthropogenic drivers of long-term ecological dynamics can be disentangled. The knowledge of the different roles of climate and anthropogenic land use on ecosystems and fire regimes gained from these natural laboratories can be applied to areas of SE Australia to inform management strategies in an era of significant ecological changes. Therefore, this thesis provides a deeper understanding of past links between ecosystem change, changes in climate, fire regimes, and human land use in SE Australia, using the Bass Strait area as a case study. Specific questions addressed include, (1) What drove vegetation and wetland changes in SE Australia during the last glacial and Holocene? (2) What was the role of humans in vegetation and fire-regime changes in SE Australia during the Holocene? (3) How can this deep-time knowledge contribute to better managing the ecosystems and fire regimes of the BSI and SE Australia at large? In order to answer these questions, multiple wetland sediment cores were analysed to reconstruct vegetation, fire, and wetland histories of one of the least researched BSI (i.e. truwana/Cape Barren Island) and compared to existing palaeoecological records from neighbouring regions of SE Australian mainland and Tasmania. The thesis places these findings into a broader regional context, by analysing changes in vegetation and fire regimes and associated drivers of change across SE Australia, applying a quantitative approach for the first time. The results suggest that climate primarily drove ecosystem change across SE Australian region in the last ~35,000 years. Specifically, temperature change and shifts in Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) were key drivers of vegetation and wetland changes during the last glacial period, while sea-level change, and precipitation changes related to El Nino Southern Oscillation and SWW were more important during the Holocene. Indigenous people used fire to maintain open and diverse woodlands during the Holocene, and a combination of climate and anthropogenic land use controlled Holocene fire regimes across SE Australia. On a finer spatial scale, insights from the BSI suggest Indigenous frequent burning reduced the area burnt by climate-driven fires during the Holocene. Indigenous fire management minimized contiguous woody fuel accumulation over the landscape, which in turn reduced fire spread. The suppression of Indigenous cultural fire management by European colonisation, combined with climate change, created novel fire regimes in SE Australia in the last 200 years. The reinstatement of an Indigenous cultural burning approach is recommended to help reduce the occurrence of destructive fires in SE Australian forests and to preserve rare ecosystems, such as heathlands. This will help in restoring ecosystem health and biocultural heritage in SE Australia. Monitoring of wetland hydrology and salinity is also recommended to preserve wetlands of significant ecological values in Bass Strait and the wider region.",2022,19/7/2022 2:59,19/7/2022 3:00,19/7/2022 2:59,,350,,,NA,,"Palaeoecology of Southeast Australian Ecosystems, with a Focus on the Bass Strait Area",,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798835542802,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\Y5PBG2D2\Adeleye_2022_Palaeoecology of Southeast Australian Ecosystems, with a Focus on the Bass.pdf",,2 - ALA cited

The data derived from experts are in two forms: (1) habitat condition scores for specified areas at a specified date range, and; (2) habitat condition scores based on images (photographs) of ecosystems. The image based habitat condition data were collected to enable cross-calibration of contributed site assessment data. These data represent the start of a continent-wide library of ecological condition data suitable for training and validation of model-based approaches to habitat condition assessment.Methods - site assessmentsExperts recorded their assessment of habitat condition for areas within Australia using a data capture tool hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia. Experts mapped site/s with which they have deep familiarity, using polygons. The sites may be small or large, depending on the area over which a consistent condition score can be applied. For each site, experts provided a condition score between 0 and 1 (1=pristine; 0=natural habitat completely removed), the time period of their assessment, and (optionally) disturbances influencing the score. Methods - image assessmentsExperts recorded their assessment of images using a data capture tool hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia. The image assessment scores are intended to be used to calibrate the site assessment condition scores contributed by experts. Experts were asked to provide a condition score for a suite of images allocated to them based on the Major Vegetation Groups (MVG) and Hutchinson bioclimatic classifications that they nominated familiarity with during the project registration process. The calibration images characterised each ecosystem in several different condition states.Data productsThe condition assessments of sites contributed by experts were formatted and prepared into the following files:SiteConditionAssessment.csv - Site assessment data of on-ground habitat condition for the 314 sites contributed by experts.Descriptor_SiteConditionAssessment.csv - A file describing the fields used in the SiteConditionAssessment data file.The image assessment data were formatted and prepared into the following files:ImageAssessment.csv - Data on the 278 image assessments of habitat condition, undertaken by experts.Descriptor_ImageAssessment.csv - A file describing the fields used in the ImageAssessment.csv data file.",2022,18/7/2022 2:27,18/7/2022 2:33,18/7/2022 2:27,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,,not specified,,,,,Web of Science Nextgen,,,NA,,,1 - ALA used; ALA author

These repositories remain largely disconnected and only partially findable. The Australian Reference Genome Atlas (ARGA) Project is solving the problem of genomics data obscurity by creating an online platform where life sciences researchers can comprehensively and confidently search for data for taxa relevant to Australian research. At its most basic, ARGA is a tool for aggregating and indexing publicly available genomics (and genetics) data. We aim to improve the experience of discovering and accessing this data by building search functionality, based on features such as phenotypic traits and predicted and observed species distributions, and supporting data packaging and transfer to analysis environments. ARGA will index GenBank (National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA), the European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-ENA), the database of Bioplatforms Australia, and selected DNA repositories in Australian faunal collections and herbaria. We will integrate these records with the occurrence records and taxonomic framework of the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) to enrich the data and make it searchable using taxonomy, location, ecological characteristics and selected phenotypic data.             The chief aims and outputs for the project are to:                                                                create a system to enable contextual metadata about a species to be used as a pointer to a variety of genomic data associated with that species;                                                     add functionality to that system to enable additional contextual information groupings, and community curation of these created groupings;                                                     create a user-facing web-accessible interface for the system; and                                                     devise a mechanism that allows the researchers searching the multiple genomic repositories, via ARGA, to select files for subsequent analysis and export them to other cloud-based analysis infrastructure.                                                          create a system to enable contextual metadata about a species to be used as a pointer to a variety of genomic data associated with that species;             add functionality to that system to enable additional contextual information groupings, and community curation of these created groupings;             create a user-facing web-accessible interface for the system; and             devise a mechanism that allows the researchers searching the multiple genomic repositories, via ARGA, to select files for subsequent analysis and export them to other cloud-based analysis infrastructure.

A total area of 0.1 ha of native vegetation will be cleared as part of the proposed development. This BAR considers the impact of the proposal on threatened flora and fauna species, populations and ecological communities listed on the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (BC Act) and the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 2000 (EPBC Act) to determine whether the proposed subdivision will trigger the NSW Biodiversity Offset Scheme (BOS) or require referral to the Commonwealth under the EPBC Act. The study area covers 1.24 hectares (ha) on Lot 16 DP1255866 located in the Orange City Council Local Government Area and lies on the Mullion Slopes BioNet NSW Landscape (Mitchell, 2002), in the Orange Subregion of the South Eastern Highlands IBRA Bioregion. Database searches were undertaken in May 2022 to prepare a list of threatened species potentially occurring in the study area or surrounding area. Historical records of threatened flora and fauna species, populations, ecological communities and critical habitat were searched in the NSW BioNet Atlas database and using the Commonwealth Protected Matters Search Tool. The Protected Matters Search tool returned 13 bird species, three frogs, two reptiles, one insect, three fish, six mammals and 11 plants with potential to occur in a 20km radius of the Study area. BioNet returned sightings records of 20 bird species, three plant and five mammal species within the same area. A site assessment and survey was undertaken on the 5th May, 2022. A site walkover was carried out to identify habitat features and vegetation was sampled using vegetation integrity plots using the BAM (2020) method. Native vegetation on the study area is present as two patches of native woodland, which were identified as Plant Community Type (PCT) 1330: Yellow Box - Blakely's Red Gum grassy woodland on the tablelands, South Eastern Highlands Bioregion. The remainder of the study area is cleared grassland dominated by exotic grasses and forbs. One BAM plot was sampled in each vegetation type. A total of 61 flora species was recorded in the study area, of which 22 (36%) are native, 1 (2%) is a planted native and 38 (62%) are introduced species. Of the threatened species identified by database searches, 4 species are considered to potentially occur in the study area based on their habitat requirements and the vegetation features observed during site visits in May 2022. These are the Superb Parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), Pink-tailed Legless Lizard (Aprasia parapulchella), Small Purple Pea (Swainsona recta) and the Silky Swainson-pea (Swainsona sericea). Three of these species are listed for protection under the EPBC Act 1999. These are the Small Purple Pea, Pink-tailed Legless Lizard and Superb Parrot. The native woodland, PCT 1330 is part of the White box, Yellow Box, Blakely's Red Gum ecological community which is listed as a Critically Endangered Ecological Community (Box Gum Woodland CEEC) on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act (EPBC) 1999 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act (BC) 2016. The subdivision has been designed to avoid and minimise impacts on biodiversity, using the following strategies: - Clearing has been minimised to the greatest possible extent. Of the 0.3 hectares of native vegetation on the study area, 0.1 hectares will be permanently removed, and 0.2 hectares will be retained.- Vegetation to be retained will be demarcated with flagging tape to ensure avoidance during construction.- No machinery will be parked inside the boundary of native vegetation to be retained - Clearing protocols will ensure that trees are checked for nests or roosting fauna prior to felling as per RTA best practice guidelines - All rubbish and other materials will be removed from the site once construction is complete. The potential for impact on the four threatened species and the Box Gum Woodland CEEC was assessed using 5-part Tests of Significance. It was found that once avoidance measures are carried out, no significant impact on threatened species or ecological communities is likely as a result of the proposed subdivision development. It was also determined that the removal of 0.1 ha of Box Gum Woodland is not likely to represent a Serious and Irreversible Impact, and that no referral is required to the Commonwealth Government under the EPBC Act.",9/6/2022,15/8/2022 0:23,24/3/2023 2:33,,Jan-44,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Orion Consulting,"New South Wales, Australia",English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\QS2XFTAR\Lindsay et al_2022_Sophie Drive Subdivision.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

This is the report of vertebrate fauna recorded for the survey. In total, we observed and recorded 81 species of vertebrate animals; this included six frog species, six reptiles, nine mammals, and 60 birds (see Appendix 1). In addition, we also recorded microbats (Vespertilionidae) across the site using an ultrasonic bat detector; however, it was not possible to identify these against our species recordings. From point data, we reported 141 records of vertebrate animals at Stony Head, including 78 observations of birds, ten frogs, 47 mammals, and six reptiles (see Appendix 2). Some species observed by other members of the Bush Blitz survey team are reported in Appendix 1 but are not associated with the point data locations in Appendix 2. Five threatened species were recorded (Aquila audax, Haliaeetus leucogaster, Thinornis cucullatus, Sarcophilus harrisii, Litoria raniformis) and seven exotic or pest species detected (Felis catus, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Alauda arvensis, Dacelo novaeguineae, Carduelis carduelis, Chloris chloris and Sturnus vulgaris). Two species records, Thinornis cucullatus (hooded dotterel) and Sminthopsis leucopus (white-footed dunnart), are likely to be range extensions for these species. Most records were the result of direct observation, with animals either spotted using binoculars or photographed using a camera with a telephoto lens. Audio monitoring was an effective method for detecting and identifying frogs, while recordings of bat calls proved more difficult to identify. Examination of scats and tracks was a reliable method of detection for certain nocturnal wildlife, such as wombats (Vombatus ursinus) and Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii), with trackways on beaches being the only record of feral cats. Water rat (Hydromys chrysogaster) tracks were also common on beaches. Scats and tracks also guided the positioning of camera traps, which proved effective as a means of identifying nocturnal mammals. These results provide data about the vertebrate animals present at this site; trapping (e.g. for small mammals or bats) would likely lead to the detection of additional cryptic species that were otherwise not recorded using observational approaches. For example, an opportunistic sighting of a white-footed dunnart (Sminthopsis leucopus) demonstrates that they were present on the site, but these were not detected otherwise via our survey methods.",19/10/2021,9/8/2022 8:04,24/3/2023 2:31,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,Australia,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MNUWF6EB\Hocking_Clarke_2021_Stony Head Bush Blitz.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

This outstanding diversity of around 30% of the known Tasmanian lepidopteran fauna can be attributed to the significant ecological values of this property. Eleven native lepidopteran pests were recorded but none are considered to potentially invasive. The extreme abundance of the southern armyworm during the survey does not seem to have resulted in an outbreak of caterpillars this Spring in northern Tasmania.",20/12/2021,9/8/2022 7:40,24/3/2023 2:28,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,Australia,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MMIKSG2K\Byrne_2021_Stony Head Bush Blitz.pdf,,6 - ALA published

As cities replace natural landscapes, remaining habitat remnants are often highly fragmented and degraded, presenting a difficult challenge for urban dwelling wildlife. While many species are unable to persist in cities, others not only survive but thrive in the hostile landscape. A key area of research in urban ecology is identifying the combinations of traits that characterise successful urban exploiting species, as well as the mechanisms that allow species with disadvantageous traits to survive in highly modified landscapes. I examined the impacts of urbanisation on the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), an atypical urban exploiting species. Despite possessing several apparently disadvantageous traits, including poor flight ability and ground nesting, brush-turkeys are currently colonising cities along the east coast of Australia. I used a combination of historical data, citizen science, and field observations to quantify changes in the distribution and behaviour of brush-turkeys in urban areas. I found that the brushturkey range has greatly fluctuated over time, however the species has greatly expanded into major cities. I found their fear behaviour is reduced in urban areas compared to their natural habitat and documented long distance dispersal behaviours within an urban landscape for the first time in this species. Additionally, I examined the potential for brush-turkeys to act as ecosystem engineers through measurements of leaf litter decomposition rate around their incubation mounds and found that their digging behaviour speeds up decomposition closer to the mounds.  My results highlight that brush-turkeys are a highly successful urban colonising species, despite their disadvantageous traits, and identify some of the mechanisms that may enable the species to thrive in cities. This demonstrates the difficulties of predicting which species are likely to thrive in urban areas from their traits alone. This research also demonstrates the value of citizen science for long term monitoring of charismatic species in urban areas and the potential role of targeted, species-specific, projects. Understanding the pathways through which species adapt to urban ecosystems will improve our capacity to manage these systems and predict how they will change into the future.",2022-07,4/8/2022 1:06,4/8/2022 7:09,4/8/2022,,174,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Sydney,"Sydney, AUSTRALIA",English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UB3FDFG5\Hall_Ecology of the Australian brush-turkey in Urban Ecosystems.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records; Climate Data; Spatial Portal; Tweetable 🕊️; MaxEnt; Animals

Among 45 braconid subfamilies, Cardiochilinae Ashmead, 1900 has had little attention by braconid taxonomists during the previous twenty years. In this dissertation, seven cardiochiline genera, Bohayella Belokobylskij, 1987, Heteropteron Brulle, 1846, Neocardiochiles Szepligeti, 1908, Orientocardiochiles Kang & Long, 2020, Retusigaster Dangerfield, Austin, & Whitfield, 1999, Schoenlandella Cameron, 1905 and Wesmaelella Spinola, 1851 are taxonomically reviewed and investigated. Orientocardiochiles was described as a new genus, the first new genus in the last twenty-three years. Neocardiochiles has been resurrected, and the relationships among Heteropteron, Neocardiochiles, and Wesmaelella were re-evaluated using a phylogeny based on morphological data. In the Neocardiochiles project, five new species of Neocardiochiles were described and five new combinations proposed. New distribution records of Bohayella from Costa Rica and Ecuador were reported, and three new species of the genus have been described. In addition, six species of Retusigaster and Schoenlandella have been newly described with information about potential food sources for R. arugosus (Mao, 1949) and R. pushi Kang, 2022 and potential host insect species of S. montserratensis Kang, 2021.

Within the Melastomatoideae, the majority are in the tribes Melastomateae (14), Miconieae (6), and Sonerileae (6). The native ranges of most are in the Neotropics and almost all have established populations on islands outside of their native ranges. Miconia crenata, a Neotropical native, was likely moved unintentionally to most of its introduced range and is currently found on three continents and four island regions outside its native range. It has established high-density populations on some islands and continents and has been the target of several biological control agents. Another native of the Neotropics, Miconia calvescens was introduced for its showy foliage and has become naturalized in parts of Oceania and Sri Lanka. It now dominates native forests and affects ecosystem processes in French Polynesia and Hawaii, USA, and has been the target of intensive management efforts including biological control.

Along with the Murray Mouth and Estuary, and Lower Lakes it forms a wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. The combined impacts of reduced flows from the River Murray and other anthropogenic impacts, exacerbated during the Millennium Drought (particularly during the period 2001- 2010), have resulted in long-term declines in the ecological condition of the Coorong. This is most notable in the South Lagoon, where increased eutrophication, hypersalinity and other impacts have resulted in a significant loss of ecosystem function. The Healthy Coorong, Healthy Basin Program (HCHB) represents a government commitment to improve the health of the Coorong. Part of the commitment is to conduct Scientific Trials and Investigations (T&I) to provide knowledge that informs the future management of the Coorong and facilitate restoration and maintenance of ecological condition, particularly for the South Lagoon. Investigations for 'Restoring a functioning Coorong food web' forms Component 3 of the HCHB T&I Project. The primary objectives were to improve understanding of food web dynamics by investigating the diet, prey availability and energy supply for key biota (waterbirds and fish) in the Coorong and develop a quantitative food web model. This report details the outputs of Activity 3.4 'Ecosystem models to inform the development of strategies to restore a functioning South Lagoon food web in the Coorong', which specifically aimed to develop quantitative food web models for the North Coorong (Murray Estuary and North Lagoon) and South Lagoon and use these models to inform the development of strategies to restore a functioning South Lagoon food web. This report presents the results of work completed during the period from April 2021 to May 2022. Trophic mass balance models of the North Coorong (i.e. Goolwa Barrages to Parnka Point North) and South Lagoon (i.e. Parnka Point South to Salt Creek) sections of the Coorong ecosystem were developed using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. The North Coorong and South Lagoon ecosystem models were composed of 56 and 48 trophic groups respectively, including mammals, birds, chondrichthyans, teleosts, invertebrates, autotrophs, and detritus. The base Ecopath models used available data to estimate four key parameters: biomass (B), production per biomass (P/B), consumption per unit of biomass (Q/B) and ecotrophic efficiency (EE). A significant portion of this report details how these parameters were estimated for each trophic group and will form important assumptions for future ecological studies. Each model required a detailed dietary matrix and information on the landings and discard estimates for the commercial fishing fleet (target species by fishing gear type). Models were balanced using three of the four key parameters, with the final parameter value estimated by the model. Ecopath models were constructed to represent the status of each ecosystem in 1984-85, to coincide with the initial year of commercial fishery logbook data for the Lakes and Coorong fishery. Ecopath models were used to develop time dynamic models in Ecosim, using a combination of best available data from the commercial fishery, fish research sampling and bird abundance data obtained across a 37-year time period (1984-85 to 2020-21). These provided a total of 67 and 44 individual reference time-series data sets for the North Coorong and South Lagoon ecosystem models, respectively, including estimates of annual catch, fishing effort, and relative biomass (CPUE) of key commercially targeted species (e.g. yelloweye mullet, mulloway, black bream, flounder); annual fish catch sampling data for other fish taxa, and annual data from the Coorong waterbird monitoring program. Environmental forcing time-series for flow (barrage flow/Salt Creek flow), water level and salinity were fitted to the reference biological time-series using the nutrient loading forcing function application of Ecosim. For both the North Coorong and South Lagoon models, the addition of environmental time-series data (e.g. flow, water level, salinity) with the nutrient loading forcing function and a primary production anomaly, provided the best models. Fits to annual mean salinity produced better model fits than mean annual water level, and water level produced better model fits than total annual barrage (North Coorong) or Salt Creek flows (South Lagoon). To provide information to assist assessments of potential infrastructure developments on ecosystem recovery, scenarios were developed that examined the response relationships between key bird and fish",2022,30/10/2022 23:28,24/3/2023 2:38,31/10/2022,117,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,Goyder Institute for Water Research Technical Report Series,Goyder Institude for Water Research,"Adelaide, South Australia",English,,Technical Report,,,Zotero,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\YMUDSTGB\Pierce - Goyder Institute Technical Report Series.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Images

This study will focus on four Australian orchid genera which form orchid mycorrhizal associations with the fungus Serendipita. The expected outcome is to construct a continent-wide phylogeny and establish a biogeographical pattern of distribution for Serendipita in Australia. First, I focused on fungal symbionts in two Caladenia species-pair contrasts, each pairing one widely distributed species with a closely-related species of narrow distribution. The widespread Caladenia pectinata and narrowly distributed C. procera both associate with two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the fungal genus Serendipita. While, four OTUs were identified in widespread C. tentaculata compared to one OTU in the narrow endemic C. atrovespa. Germination trials showed seeds from all orchids are compatible with more OTUs than were observed in adult plants, especially in later germination stages which required fungal OTUs which more associated with adult plants. Given that more OTUs were able to both initiate and fully germinate orchid seeds suggesting lower specificity during germination. Fungi germinating narrowly distributed orchids are themselves widespread and are therefore unlikely to limit orchid distribution. Second, I investigated whether Serendipita fungi in Australia are broadly distributed at the continental scale, whether Serendipita Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) are shared between southwest (SWA) and southeast Australia (SEA) and whether SWA, which has low soil fertility, also have a higher Serendipita diversity. Serendipita OTUs were identified based on 4.1 % sequence divergence on Inters Region (ITS). Fungal symbiont diversity of speciespair comparisons of five orchid genera (Eriochillus - Eriochilidinae, Caladenia, Elythranthera, Glossodia, - Caladeniinae, Cyrtostylis - Acianthinae), one species of each genus occurring in either SWA or SEA, were investigated. In total, 35 OTUs of Serendipita were identified with ITS sequencing from the collar region of eight orchid species pairs. Depending on the genus of studied orchids, some genera were highly specialised in their fungal associations, while orchids in the genus Eriochilus are true generalists associating with 30 OTUs. This study shows that a widespread orchid distribution may be achieved by forming an association with a range of mycorrhizal partners or with a few widespread fungi and potentially not limiting orchid distribution. In total, 14 of the 35 OTUs were found on both sides of the continent, suggesting either long-distance dispersal or historic step-wise dispersal on a continuous landscape. Elucidating fungal distribution patterns have important consequences for future conservation studies, potentially highlighting recruitment sites with specific fungi for endangered orchids. The number of Serendipita OTUs, Shannon's diversity and phylogenetic diversity of Serendipita did not differ significantly between geographic regions. Therefore, low soil fertility in SWA does not result in a higher apparent Serendipita diversity. Third, I investigated whether symbiotic orchid seed germination always exhibits lower fungal specificity during in vitro germination as previously thought, employing multiple Australian common sebacinoid orchid species. While some species showed similar mycorrhizal specificity in both germination and adulthood, the other studied orchid species could be germinated by more Serendipita OTUs than those found in adult plants, suggesting lower mycorrhizal specificity during germination. No significant difference in the mean of the number of OTUs could germinate orchid seeds and OTUs found in adult roots.",2021,18/10/2022 1:10,14/3/2023 3:42,18/10/2022 1:10,,272,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,DOI: 10.25911/3C22-NG45,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\78STC5Y8\Oktalira_2021_Diversity of Serendipitaceae Mycorrhizal Associations of Australian Terrestrial.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Large groups can now resolve issues together in completely different ways, which has transformed the arts, sciences, business, education, technology, and medicine. Collective intelligence is something we share with animals and is different from machine learning and artificial intelligence. To design and utilize human collective intelligence, we must understand how its problem-solving mechanisms work. From democracy in ancient Athens, through the invention of the printing press, to COVID-19, this book analyzes how humans developed the ability to find solutions together. This wide-ranging, thought-provoking book is a game-changer for those working strategically with collective problem solving within organizations and using a variety of innovative methods. It sheds light on how humans work effectively alongside machines to confront challenges that are more urgent than what humanity has faced before.

Prediction of threats before the crisis is necessary, to control biodiversity damage.These are proved in several published papers on different models which undertook prediction; especially on three models viz BIOCLIM, GARP and MAXENT. The main concept of every paper is predicting the distribution and habitat suitable areas of species based on the available occurrence data. The occurrence data includes georeferenced data of locations collected from direct field visits, herbariums, voucher specimens etc. Prediction of habitat suitable areas of pests and their hosts before their occurrence are made possible by these models. Quarantine measures over habitat suitable areas of pest and host before pest attack, prevent the damage caused by pest infestation. ENM (Ecological Niche Modelling) predicts the distribution and habitat suitable areas of rare and endangered plants. Reestablishment of these species is promising, if conserved in habitat suitable areas. Modelling techniques predict the lands prone to natural hazards like floods, landslides, earthquakes, and other natural calamities, thereby preventing loss of biodiversity, economic loss etc..

The index is built by merging lists from multiple Australian authoritative taxonomic sources into a single taxonomic tree. Where the primary data sources are incomplete, we attempt to pad out missing genera and species with alternative sources, for example, using Catalog of Life for some fungi branches, and classification of kingdoms: Viruses, Chromista, Protozoa and Bacteria. When the ALA ingests occurrence records or species checklists, we attempt to match the supplied names against the index using our name matching service. All going well, the service returns the authoritative persistent identifiers for the matched taxon concept and all of the parent taxon concepts. The name matching service will attempt fuzzy and higher rank matches in an attempt to ensure that every record in the ALA finds a home in the taxonomic tree.

GXZXWU95,conferencePaper,2022,"Mora-Cross, Maria Auxiliadora; Vargas, Manuel; Ulate, William",Sharing Species Pages through Living Atlases using Plinian Core: Current state and new developments,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,,,10.3897/biss.6.94718,https://biss.pensoft.net/article/94718/,"Living Atlases (living-atlases.gbif.org) is a community of developers and organizations built around the software platform developed by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, ala.org.au). ALA includes a number of open source reusable modules designed to assemble biodiversity data portals. Nowadays, more than 25 institutional and national biodiversity portals around the world have been implemented with the ALA tools (living-atlases.gbif.org/participants). The community organizes workshops and prepares training materials to present ALA modules to other institutions that want to implement it, to improve already existing portals and to learn from each other's achievements (living-atlases.gbif.org/about). ALA based portals integrate data from multiple sources using biodiversity data standards ruled by TDWG, such as Darwin Core for species occurrences. The Living Atlases community is working in the integration of other data types, like species records and sampling events.             Plinian Core (PliC) is a generalistic specification, oriented to share descriptions and nomenclature, as well as many other aspects (e.g. legal, conservation, and management details) of species level information from local and regional sources (Pando 2018). Following several years of development and earlier versions, PliC version 3.1 was made publicly available in 2012. The following year, after the approval of the ""Species Information Interest Group'' by the TDWG Executive, a TDWG Task Group was created to start aligning Plinian Core with the TDWG Standards Documentation Standard (SDS). Several full-fledged implementations of Plinian Core were produced, between 2014 and 2019, including the Atlas of Living Costa Rica (CRBio.cr), the Cross-Nature Project (datos.iepnb.es), the Vasque Country (Spain) Official Nature Information System (ivap.euskadi.eus), the Colombian Biodiversity Catalog (catalogo.biodiversidad.co) and Enciclovida (Mexican Species Catalog, enciclovida.mx). These last three years, the Plinian Core Task Group has reviewed definitions of terms and formal declarations, assisted by the TDWG Technical Architecture Group (TAG), with the objective of ratifying PliC as a TDWG Standard.             One of the most used tools to share standardized biodiversity data is the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT, gbif.org/en/ipt). The IPT is an open source web application that allows institutions to standardize, to publish and share biodiversity data sets through Living Atlases, GBIF, and other biodiversity networks. The toolkit simplifies the process of publishing core data types (e.g. taxon occurrence, taxon checklists, sampling event) and, by means of extensions, it is possible to associate additional data with records of the core type. As part of our project, the extensions of PliC, accessible in the IPT Sandbox, were validated to show how they can be used by institutions to publish species pages through the IPT.             In order to fully integrate Plinian Core based species pages into the ALA architecture, the Biodiversity Informatics Research Center (CRBio) has been working on the adoption of the Biodiversity Information Explorer (BIE), an ALA module which manages taxonomic and species contents by integrating global resources like EOL or Wikipedia. This adoption includes the required modifications of the Portal codebase to use the data model of the Plinian Core (github.com/tdwg/PlinianCore) to display a much richer content. This year, with assistance from the Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) from GBIF, we have revisited the integration of species pages information and expanded the content and type of information provided by the Atlas of Living Costa Rica.             We present here the updated ALA Species Pages (ALA-BIE) and Index (BIE-Index) Modules and general documentation that could be applied to any ALA installation in order to prepare species records using the IPT and PliC standard, index and display them through the ALA-BIE Module.",12/9/2022,30/9/2022 3:52,30/9/2022 4:42,30/9/2022 3:52,e94718,,,6,NA,,Sharing Species Pages through Living Atlases using Plinian Core,,NA,NA,,,,not specified,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\XXERRRCZ\Mora-Cross et al_2022_Sharing Species Pages through Living Atlases using Plinian Core.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed

YNRE9G3D,computerProgram,2022,"Hill, Lionel; Hobern, Donald","Catches of numerous insect species in Rothamsted 160W light trap at Devonport, Tasmania, 1992-2019",,,,,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/drci/full-record/DRCI:DATA2022139024811985,"These data derive from decades of near-continuous (1992 - 2019, apart from 2008 and 2009) operation of a 160W Rothamsted-design light trap at Stony Rise Centre, Devonport, Tasmania, Australia. Stony Rise was the last of several long term, continuous trapping sites operated over this period by the Tasmanian state agricultural agency, currently known as the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania. The light was normally operated every night, with all individuals of selected taxa counted. There were 5433 trapping events covering 7897 nights including 4167 single-night events, 502 two-night events, 516 three-night events and 165 four-night events. The remaining 83 events were variously 5-14 nights duration. There were 194 sporadic nights when the trap malfunctioned, which is about 2.5% of 7897 nights in the main trapping periods. The trap did not operate for extended periods (3-6 months) in early 1996, early 1998, all of 2007, all of 2008, all of 2009, early 2010 and late 2015. Enumeration of catches ceased on 6 February 2019. A total of 222,146 specimens were identified and enumerated for the data set. Dataset The initial focus of the trapping was on Noctuidae and insect species of economic importance for Tasmanian agriculture. The taxa selected for identification and counts grew from 104 taxa in 1992 to 273 taxa in 2019. Consequently, absence of some species from early samples should not be considered to indicate absence of these species. During periods in which any species was included in counts, a record is always included for the species in question, with a count of zero if no individuals were detected. During periods in which the species was not included in counts, no record is included for the species and period in question. Hence zero counts can always be considered to represent true absence within the sample of identified insects. An explanation of the survey work leading to this dataset and an overview of species included was published in Hill, L., 2013b, Long-term light trap data from Tasmania, Australia, Plant Protection Quarterly Vol.28(1) (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274700470_Long-term_light_trap_data_from_Tasmania_Australia). The bibliography lists publications derived from analysis of these data. Purpose The focus was on prognosis of Persectania ewingii Westwood, southern armyworm and several other noctuid pests such as Helicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren), native budworm and Agrotis species, true cutworms, which were all subsequently shown to undertake substantial annual immigration from mainland Australia to Tasmania across Bass Strait (Drake et al. 1981, Hill 1993, Hill 2007a). The reliability of using light trap catches to forecast larval outbreaks of southern armyworm was determined empirically since 1953 (Hill, L. 2013c). A history of forecasting outbreaks of the southern armyworm, Persectania ewingii (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Tasmania. Plant Protection Quarterly Vol.28(1), 15-21. Many frequent or infrequent vagrant Lepidoptera and other taxa were detected and the status of some of these was asserted in scientific publications (Hill 2011a, 2012a, 2013d, 2014, 2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2017). Sex ratio data for 38 species of Noctuidae was collected but is not provided in this dataset. Data from similar traps at other Tasmanian sites, back to 1953 for a few species, as described by Hill (2013c) is held variously in hardcopy format by the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania. It is available on request. Temporal scope January 1, 1992 - February 6, 2019 Geographic scope Stony Rise Centre, Devonport, Tasmania, Australia Taxonomic scope 227 species or higher taxa of Lepidoptera, representing about 30 families. 7 taxa of Coleoptera, representing 2 families. 6 taxa of Diptera representing 6 families. 12 taxa of Hemiptera representing 6 families. 3 taxa of Hymenoptera representing 1 family. 16 taxa of Neuroptera representing 5 families. 1 taxon of Blattodea. 1 taxon of Orthoptera. Methodology Study extent The light trap was installed at Stony Rise Centre (government offices), 1 Rundle Street, Devonport, Tasmania (146.32 E, 41.18 S). Sampling The trap was similar to the Rothamsted-design traps operated in the United Kingdom, consisting of a clear glass or Perspex, truncated pyramid of 52 cm square base, 22 cm height and 12 cm top aperture surrounding a square, glass funnel of slightly lesser height with 20 cm top aperture and 4 cm bottom aperture. This was mounted on a wooden base-board about 1.3 m above ground under a ridged, steel roof. A 160 W mercury vapour bulb was suspended within the funnel from the ceiling of the roof cavity, in which a clock switch was fitted. Clearance between the top aperture of the funnel and the ceiling of the roof was about 4 cm. The catch was collected into a single 10 cm square glass jar with a plaster of Paris floor bearing tetrachlorethane killing fluid and with a 9 cm orifice screwed to the underside of the baseboard. This jar contained a piece of crumpled paper towel to reduce rubbing of specimens. In December 2015 the trap was rebuilt in stainless steel to the same dimensions and using the original collection pyramid and funnel. The clock switch was replaced by a light sensitive switch. Quality control Only selected insect species were sorted and identified, counted and written into a data file. Some insects were only sorted and counted using supraspecific ranks. The range of included species grew over the period. Records for each interval exclude taxa which were not sorted or identified during the period in question. Hence zero counts indicate absence of the insects concerned during a trapping period. Method steps In the study, all individual records of selected target insect species were collected, identified to species level and counted yielding qualitative (species) and quantitative (number of individuals within each species) data for the entire study period. The recorded taxa are listed in taxon.csv in this dataset, along with summary information on the first and last events during which the taxon was monitored, the number of events in which the taxon could have been detected, the actual number in which it was detected, the total number of individuals detected, and the number of individuals detected in each year from 1992 to 2019 and in each month of the year. All handling and identification of material was carried out consistently throughout the entire period by the same researcher. Over 9000 specimens in several hundred taxa from this light trap are preserved in the Tasmanian Agricultural Insect Collection, Hobart, Tasmania (https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co131). Note specimen records are not included in this dataset. Images of representative specimens of most recorded taxa are included in the image subfolder and listed in image.csv. For insects identified only to genus or higher, it should not be assumed that all records over the period matched the species illustrated. The data were prepared for publication as a Darwin Core sampling event dataset via a series of transformations within Excel and comprises the following CSV files: event.csv (Darwin Core sampling event records) and occurrence.csv (Darwin Core occurrence records linked to event.csv by eventID). Two other CSV files are included but not mapped through the Darwin Core Archive meta.xml. First, image.csv lists images of example specimens of many of the taxa recorded in the dataset. These images are included in the image folder. Secondly, taxon.csv summarises the taxa referenced within occurrence.csv, cross-references the images as associatedMedia and provides summary counts for the number of individuals of each taxon recorded in each year of the study and in each calendar month through the period.

From differences in allele frequencies or trait frequencies among populations, we can make inferences about the forces that are most important in selection and gene flow at a specific point in time for specific systems. In this dissertation, I used Arabidopsis thaliana and tropical trees to investigate variation in response to abiotic pressures across populations. I considered two of the biotic pressures that constrain abiotic adaptation: life history traits and animal dispersers. I modeled phenotypic change across a continent through time in response to understand how phenotypes vary in response to climate. Next, I modeled genetic phenological traits within and among populations and compared to phenological variation in the wild to examine the source of this potentially adaptive variation. Finally, I compared population structure between Metopium toxiferum and Bursera simaruba to investigate the importance of an abundant avian disperser in moving seeds across the landscape. I found regional differences in Arabidopsis response to abiotic pressures and evidence that some phenotypic change is constrained by axes of life history variation. I showed that genetic traits explain phenology trait distributions in the wild. I discovered that the large differences in population genetics between two tropical trees was not clearly related to the nesting behavior of an avian disperser. The patterns of variation we see across populations and along environmental gradients are likely shaped both by trait covariation within species and by community interactions. I argue that phenology has played a role in both of these factors and is an important consideration in plant adaptation at the population level.",2020-12,7/9/2022 1:32,7/9/2022 2:58,7/9/2022 1:32,,185,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Pennsylvania State University,United States -- Pennsylvania,English,Copyright ProQuest Dissertations Publishing 2020,Ph.D.,,,,,ISBN: 9798535588735,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\9D4VE6HP\DeLeo_2020_Genetic and Phenotypic Spatial Variation among PlantPopulations.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned; Plants

The framework uses a system-agnostic Python codebase to create and update Darwin Core archives: building an archive from a core and extension csv files, merging two archives together, deleting records and identifying duplicates based on the identifiers. The framework dynamicly supports current Darwin Core and GBIF namespace terms. Previously, this functionality was handled internally by a Java-based biocache-store ingestion application. While flexible and easy to call, this black box approach to data management created challenges like removing problem records and tracking and verifying data sources. Last year, as the ALA merged our ingestion codebase with GBIF's pipelines and upgraded our data store infrastructure, we took the opportunity to manage our source data exclusively as full Darwin Core archives, rather than partial text files or spreadsheets. Consequently, the Python-based framework consolidates a lot of work previously managed using a range of methodologies and technologies including Talend, Java and unix based scripting. Alongside the Darwin Core archive manipulation tools, it has handlers for harvesting data from secure external web services, web hosts or file servers. The standardised approach to data loading paves the way for improved automation and workflow. The work has the potential to become an open source project to share with the Living Atlas and biodiversity informatics communities.",2022-08,30/8/2022 4:58,30/8/2022 4:59,30/8/2022 4:58,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Pensoft Publishers,"Sofia, Bulgaria",English,"© 2022.

BAKJM4Y2,thesis,2020,"Blanco, Cintia Maria Rodrigues",Proposed taxonomy and framework to support the decision-making of investments in Big Science,,,,,https://publications.polymtl.ca/5549/,"Over the past 70 years, Big Science projects have adopted an international dimension, which has become more complex, costly, and challenging regarding governments' decision-making in investments. Combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, this research's primary goal is to support national governments to improve their capacity to make informed and structured decisions on Big Science investments, with the participation of the scientific community and the industry. To reach this goal, two specific objectives are pursued. The first specific objective is to build a taxonomy of Big Science that provides a comprehensive understanding of the term beyond the traditional view of BigSci as high-energy physics infrastructure projects. This taxonomy is built based on research fields that, along with a proposed workable and comprehensive definition of Big Science, may be used to pre-select candidate project proposals to receive significant investments if they meet specific requirements. The second specific objective is to structure the problem of government investments in Big Science. To that effect, a set of 50 interviews with high-level Big Science stakeholders provided an in-depth portrait of the complex situation of the funding decision. The results revealed a single prime cause of the Big Science investment decision problem, which is the inherent nature of Big Science of exploring the frontier of knowledge, rather than the exorbitant amount of funding it demands. The problem structuring also revealed that to solve the problem, it is necessary to promote a decision-making process that should be objective, i.e., grounded on qualitative and/or quantitative criteria. In the end, this research proposes a systematic and customizable framework for supporting the decision-making of Big Science investments. The framework introduces the BigSci Index, which addresses any Big Science initiative and provides measures to ensure transparent, informed, and evidence-based decision-making and accountability. The scientific community, industry representatives, and government analysts are central components of the framework. The results provide a two-fold perspective: they contribute to a new understanding of the phenomenon of Big Science and offer a new approach to its funding decision problem. Adopting the proposed framework for the government decision-making of Big Science investments would ensure that decisions are well informed, follow best practices, and involve a rational, structured, and objective process. The benefits also include more effective use of public funds and greater clarity and transparency in decision-making. These, in turn, would translate into increased social, economic, political, and scientific benefits from investments in Big Science projects.",2020,19/12/2022 6:39,24/3/2023 3:03,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Polytechnique Montréal,,English,,,,,Zotero,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UCJVMBNL\Blanco - Proposed taxonomy and framework to support the dec.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

European honeybees provide important ecosystem services and aesthetic value to human gardens - we expect them to be found in natural microhabitats. European wasps, however, are often perceived as pests to humans and urban pets. We expect this species to be more common in artificial microhabitats than honeybees. Here, we study the presence of bees and wasps in urban microhabitats to better understand and document human-insect interactions in our cities. We use computer vision and machine learning tools to extract information on insect microhabitat from the backgrounds of online images of European honeybees (Apis mellifera) and wasps (Vespula germanica), classifying them as either synthetic (e.g., brickwork, food packaging, textiles) or natural (e.g., leaves, grass, flowers.). We find evidence supporting the hypothesis that wasps are more likely than honeybees to be photographed in microhabitats with synthetic elements within built environments.",2022,19/12/2022 6:10,19/12/2022 6:14,19/12/2022 6:07,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,,,English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\WH5GKCYQ\6.-Identifying-insect-microhabitat-using-image-background-analysis-Collated.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Images; Tweetable 🕊️

Use of biological control agents that persist in the environment is usually the only economically feasible option, however the processes around approvals for release of biocontrol agents can take significant amounts of time and resources, especially if screening and testing of potential agents is required.                                   This project investigates whether the European wasp could be a candidate for a renewed management programme in south-eastern Australia given the availability of a biocontrol agent following successful screening and testing of an agent,             Sphecophaga vesparum vesparum             , in the 1980s. Whether a biological control programme is worthwhile pursuing depends on the size of the benefits to industry, community and the environment from a reduction in European wasp abundance. This project explores the benefits and costs of European wasp management using a biocontrol agent, and importantly, includes valuation of the social and environmental impacts of the pest.",24/11/2022,29/11/2022 4:08,24/3/2023 2:41,29/11/2022 4:08,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Ecology,"Melbourne, Australia",English,,Preprint,,,,,DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.22.517291,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\V7IZ26AC\Cacho et al_2022_Re-evaluating management of established pests including the European wasp,.pdf",,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Modelling

MFTN2C7Q,computerProgram,2022,"Goodman, Aaron",Occurrences and R code for: Dynamic distribution modeling of the Swamp Tigertail dragonfly Synthemis eustalacta (Odonata: Anisoptera: Synthemistidae) over a 20-year bushfire regime,,,,,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/drci/full-record/DRCI:DATA2022187025351007,"Intensity and severity of bushfires in Australia have increased over the past few decades due to climate change, threatening habitat loss for numerous species. Although the impact of bushfires on vertebrates is well-documented, the corresponding effects on insect taxa are rarely examined, although they are responsible for key ecosystem functions and services. Understanding the effects of bushfire seasons on insect distributions could elucidate long-term impacts and patterns of ecosystem recovery. Here, we investigated the effects of recent bushfires, land-cover change, and climatic variables on the distribution of a common and endemic dragonfly, the swamp tigertail (Synthemis eustalacta (Burmeister, 1839)), which inhabits forests that have recently undergone severe burning. We used a temporally dynamic species distribution modeling approach that incorporated 20 years of community-science data on dragonfly occurrence and predictors based on fire, land cover, and climate to make yearly predictions of suitability. We also compared this to an approach that combines multiple temporally static models that use annual data. We found that for both approaches, fire-specific variables had negligible importance for the models, while percent of tree and non-vegetative cover were the most important. We also found that the dynamic model outperformed the static ones when evaluated with cross-validation. Model predictions indicated temporal variation in area and spatial arrangement of suitable habitat but no patterns of habitat expansion, contraction, or shifting. These results highlight not only the efficacy of dynamic modeling to capture spatiotemporal variables, such as vegetation cover for an endemic insect species, but also provide a novel approach to mapping species distributions with sparse locality records. Occurrence Records We acquired occurrence records of adult S. eustalacta from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, DOI: https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.c256kv). We first subsetted the raw data by selecting occurrence records identified as museum samples, curated research-grade community science observations, and published sightings from scientific surveys. We then filtered out records without coordinate information and those recorded outside the years 2001-2020. Finally, we restricted our analysis dataset to records from scientific institutions (Australian Museum, Queensland Museum, Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Murray Darling Basin Authority), community science websites (iNaturalist, Atlas of Living Australia), and governmental organizations (New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry, and Environment, South Australia Department for Environment and Water). In total, we acquired 483 occurrences (Table 1). Further occurrence filtering consisted of removing sightings with erroneous localities (specimens located at known institutions). Environmental Data We generated yearly sets of environmental predictor variables for modeling that included bioclimatic variables, as well as vegetation cover and seasonal burned area for the years 2001-2020. All analyses were conducted using the statistical programming language R v. 4.1.2 (Team, 2021), and all layers have a geographic coordinate system (i.e., degrees) with a WGS84 datum. We acquired monthly minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation rasters for Australia at 2.5 arcminutes resolution (approx. 5 km at the equator), produced by the Australia Bureau of Meteorology (Jones et al., 2009). From these rasters, we created a set of 19 bioclimatic variables representing means, variabilities, and extremes for temperature and precipitation using the dismo package (Hijmans et al., 2017). Due to known spatial artifacts, we omitted four of these variables that include temperature-precipitation interactions (bio08, bio09, bio18, bio19) from the analysis (Moo-Llanes et al., 2021). We also acquired remotely sensed variables from NASAs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using the MODISstp package (Busetto & Ranghetti, 2016). Landscape variables describing fire and land cover have been shown to be important predictors of dragonfly range (Jolly et al., 2022). Increases in regional fire frequency lead to higher rates of river contamination via burned carbon and metal leaching (Kelly et al., 2020; Nasirian & Irvine, 2017; Nunes et al., 2018). Tree cover heavily affects other odonate species in terms of landscape patchiness (Dolny et al., 2014; Rith-Najarian, 1998; Suhonen et al., 2010; Suhonen et al., 2013). Loss of plant cover due to fires increases ambient temperature, which can drastically affect odonate survival (Castillo-Perez et al., 2021). Based on this information and on knowledge of the species, we selected variables that we hypothesized were drivers of S. eustalacta distribution (Collins & Mcintyre, 2015; Theischinger & Hawking, 2006): vegetation continuous fields (VCF; defined as percent of pixel covered by each field) for percent tree cover, non-tree cover, and non-vegetated cover (percent tree cover subtracted from percent non-tree cover) (MOD44B, 250 m yearly resolution), annual evapotranspiration (MOD16A3, 500 m yearly resolution), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; MOD13A2, 1 km monthly resolution), and Burned Area data product (MDC64A1, 500 m monthly resolution). We calculated yearly averages of each MODIS variable to capture annual variability and resampled all variables to the coarsest resolution (2.5 arcminutes). Pixel values for Burned Area Product range from 0 (unburned) to 365 (366 for leap year), corresponding to the days of the year. From these data, we generated annual Burned Area layers by converting these values to binary (pixel values >1 = burned, 0 = unburned). Finally, we acquired categorical rasters representing Australias major vegetation groups from The Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL, https://bccvl.org.au/), and global terrestrial ecoregions from the World Wildlife Fund (https://www.worldwildlife.org). All raster analyses were conducted with the R package raster v3.5-29 (Hijmans et al., 2021). Species Distribution Modeling Before modeling, we processed our occurrences to account for sampling bias, delineated a study extent to sample background points, and omitted highly correlated environmental variables. We spatially thinned occurrences by 10 km to reduce the effects of sampling bias and artificial clustering (Veloz, 2009) using the spThin package (Aiello-Lammens et al., 2015), which resulted in more even sample sizes across years (n = 133 total; Table 1). Synthemis eustalacta is endemic to southern Australia and disperses roughly 500 m from streams in early adulthood, but upon reaching maturity, returns to its site of emergence (Theischinger & Hawking, 2006). We thus chose a study extent to include potentially unsampled areas yet exclude large areas outside the species dispersal limitations (Peterson & Soberon, 2012), defined as a minimum convex polygon around all localities (2001-2020) buffered by 1 degree (approx. 111 km at equator). Within this extent, we randomly sampled 50,000 background points for modeling and extracted their yearly environmental values. We used these values to calculate correlations between variables using the vifcor and vifstep functions in the usdm package v 1.1-18 (Naimi, 2017) and filtered out variables by year with correlation coefficients higher than 0.9 and a VIF threshold of 10. Finally, we retained variables for analysis which were kept among all yearly environmental backgrounds. To model the distribution of S. eustalacta, we used the presence-background algorithm Maxent v3.4.4 (Phillips et al., 2017), which remains one of the top-performing models for fitting SDMs with background data (Valavi et al., 2021). To automate model building and evaluation with different complexity settings and reporting of results, we used the R package ENMeval 2.0.0 (Kass et al., 2021). We constructed both dynamic models that incorporated data across years and static models that used year-specific data (Fig. 1). For the dynamic models, we extracted the environmental predictor values for each year from the occurrence and background points for that year and assembled them into a single training dataset. To construct a single background point dataset for the dynamic models, we extracted yearly environmental values for the same set of background points, then averaged these values across years per background point (we used the mode for categorical variables; Fig. 1). We evaluated models using random k-fold cross-validation, in which occurrences are randomly partitioned into a specified number of groups (i.e., folds), then models are sequentially trained on all groups but one (training data) and evaluated on the withheld group (validation data) (Hastie et al., 2009)we used four folds (k = 4) for our evaluations. As random partitioning can result in spatial autocorrelation due to clustering within folds, spatial block cross-validation techniques are often prescribed to address this (Roberts et al., 2017). However, as our occurrences varied not only in space but also in time, and as we lacked enough records per time bin to additionally separate by temporal block, we chose to use simpler random partitioning for evaluation. In contrast to the single dynamic model, we also constructed one static model per year that used only occurrence and background environmental values for that year. For this approach, we did not make models for years with fewer than five associated occurrences (Phillips et al., 2017; Phillips & Dudik, 2008). For static models, we partitioned our data using the leave-one-out strategy (referred to as jackknife in ENMeval), whereby one occurrence record is withheld from each model during cross-validation (k = n, or the number of occurrences). This cross-validation technique is most appropriate for small sample sizes, as it allows for the largest training datasets possible for model-building during cross-validation (Pearson et al., 2006; Shcheglovitova & Anderson, 2013). All final models were fitted to the full datasets. As Maxent models can lead to very different results when complexity settings are changed (Radosavljevic & Anderson, 2014; Warren & Seifert, 2011), we compared dynamic and static models with settings representing simple and complex. Feature classes determine the shape of the model fit, while regularization multipliers control how much complexity is penalizedhigh regularization multipliers can result in predictor variable coefficients shrinking to zero and thus dropping out of the model (Phillips et al., 2017). Model tuning consists of varying complexity settings, running models with combinations of these settings, and selecting optimal settings based on performance metrics. For tuning, we chose a simple model with a single linear feature class (L) and a complex model with a combination of linear, quadratic, and hinge feature classes (LQH). Hinge features provide flexible linear fits that can change direction and can considerably inflate the number of model parameters when included (Phillips & Dudik, 2008). To both allow for flexibility in the growth of model complexity and simplify comparisons between models, we set the regularization multiplier to one (the Maxent software default) for each model. We assessed the dynamic and static models using averages of threshold-dependent (omission rate) and threshold-independent (AUC) discrimination performance metrics calculated on withheld validation data, but also checked the results against the Akaike Information Criterion with correction for small samples sizes (AICc; calculated on the full dataset) (Warren & Seifert, 2011). Omission rate measures the proportion of withheld occurrence localities (i.e., those in the validation dataset) that fall outside a designated model prediction threshold. We assessed the 10-percentile omission rate, which sets this threshold as the lowest suitability value for occurrences after removing the lowest 10% suitability valuesthis avoids choosing very low thresholds that may represent outliers (Kass et al., 2021; Radosavljevic & Anderson, 2014). Validation AUC is a measure of discrimination accuracy that can be used to make relative comparisons between SDMs with different settings fit on the same data (Radosavljevic & Anderson, 2014), but is problematic to use as an absolute performance measure for presence-background models (Lobo et al., 2008). To investigate model behavior, we examined predictor variable importance values and compared background density distributions of important variables for intense fire years between models. First, we recorded the permutation importance values for predictor variables reported by Maxent. These values are calculated by randomly permuting the values of all variables but one, building a new model, then calculating the difference between each models training AUC and that of the empirical model (Phillips, 2021). Next, as we attributed summaries of predictor variables to the background points for the dynamic models, it was possible that years with extreme values (i.e., intense fire years) may have environmental distributions that are very different than these summaries, which would indicate that dynamic models could have overly smooth predictions for such years. To determine if any key differences existed between the dynamic models averaged background and the static models yearly backgrounds, we plotted background density distributions of variables with high importance for the years 2009 and 2019, then compared the shapes of these distributions with pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirov goodness-of-fit (KS) tests. We chose these two years because as they had the largest and most intense bushfires in the past 20 years in southern Australia (Van Eeden et al., 2020), we expected them to have the most extreme environmental differences between yearly and averaged backgrounds. For these plots, we chose the top three variables with the highest permutation importance shared between the simple and complex settings separately for the dynamic and static models. We made habitat suitability predictions for S. eustalacta over the study extent for each year using both the simple and complex settings for the dynamic and static models. We generated predictions by transferring all models onto our environmental variables, creating an envelope of suitability across our study extent. Maxent raw predictions were transformed to a scale of 0-1 to approximate probability of occurrence using the cloglog transformation (Phillips et al., 2017). We generated predictions for all years with the dynamic models, but only for years with sufficient (>4) occurrence records for our static models. As an additional check for differences between the two approaches, we mapped the difference in predictions of our simple and complex dynamic and static models for the intense fire years of 2009 and 2019. To better visualize raster subtractions, we generated a binary threshold prediction for our fire-prone years, calculated from the 10-percentile omission rate from our model evaluation.

The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) recognises the environmental significance of the GBSW and has prepared this advice to examine the environmental values, and the existing and potential pressures on those values. The EPA makes recommendations for enhancing the environmental protection of the GBSW and outlines expectations for proposals and planning schemes that have the potential to impact environmental values. The advice, provided under section 16(j) of the Environmental Protection Act 1986, will benefit proponents, decision makers, regulators and the public, and will be considered during the environmental impact assessment of proposals and planning schemes by the EPA. The EPA has identified that a high level of protection and coordinated management is critical for the GBSW. There are opportunities to expand the Class A nature reserve within the GBSW and its buffers to create a more contiguous reserve system. Improvements to the coordination and management through a shared and expanded partnership involving all relevant groups including, Traditional Owners, would allow for holistic management of the entire GBSW area. The EPA expects future activities and development to be compatible with the protection of the environmental values of the GBSW and considers these are not readily replaceable or interchangeable with offsets in other areas. Direct and indirect impacts to the environmental values of the GBSW should be avoided to the greatest extent possible and practicable. Proponents will need to demonstrate best practice environmental management with adaptability in design and approach to protect the environmental values and supporting ecological and hydrological processes of the GBSW. Appropriate and site-specific investigations should be undertaken both in a local and regional context, supported by the best available scientific evidence. This includes the consideration of appropriate buffers, ecological and hydrological connectivity, stormwater management and drainage, impacts on hydrology and water quality, and the potential for direct, indirect and cumulative impacts. The EPA has found that there are multiple threats to the significant environmental values of the GBSW. There is evidence of impacts to environmental values from existing and historical activities and concern about further incremental and cumulative impacts from potential future development. Continued piecemeal development without enhancing the protection of the GBSW may result in further degradation of the area's unique and significant environmental values.",2022-10,14/11/2022 3:21,24/3/2023 2:40,14/11/2022,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Environmental Protection Authority,"Western Australia, Australia",English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\5DST38CC\Environmental Values and Pressures for the Greater Brixton Street Wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

Chapter 1 introduces background literature relevant to this thesis. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 develop novel methods and software for the analysis of genetic sequencing data. Chapter 5 details a large collaborative project to establish genetic resources in the model cereal Brachypodium, and perform a genome-wide association study for several agriculturally-relevant traits under two climate change scenarios. Chapter 6 investigates the spatial genetic patterns in two species of woodland eucalypt, and determines the landscape process that could be driving these patterns. Finally, Chapter 7 summarises these works, and proposes some areas of further study. In Chapters 2 and 3, I develop methods that enable analysis of Genotyping-by-sequencing analysis. Axe, a short read sequence demultiplexer, demultiplexes samples from multiplexed GBS sequencing datasets. I show Axe has high accuracy, and outperforms previously published software. Axe also tolerates complex indexing schemes such as the variable-length combinatorial indexes used in GBS data. Trimit and libqcpp (Chapter 3) implements several low-level sequence read quality assessment and control methods as a C++ library, and as a command line tool. Both these works have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and are used by numerous groups internationally. In Chapter 4, I develop kWIP, a de novo estimator of genetic distance. kWIP enables rapid estimation of genetic distances directly from sequence reads. We first show kWIP outperforms a competing method at low coverage using simulations that mimic a population resequencing experiment. We propose and demonstrate several use cases for kWIP, including population resequencing, initial assessment of sample identity, and estimating metagenomic similarity. kWIP was published in PLoS Computational Biology. In Chapter 5, I present the results of a large, collaborative project which surveys the global genetic diversity of the model cereal Brachypodium. We amass a collection of over 2000 accessions from the Brachypodium species complex. Using GBS and whole genome sequencing we identify around 800 accessions of the diploid Brachypodium distachyon, within which we find extensive population structure and clonal families. Through population restructuring we create a core collection of 74 accessions containing the majority of genetic diversity in the ""A genome"" sub-population. Using this core collection, we assay several phenotypes of agricultural interest including early vigour, harvest index and energy use efficiency under two climates, and dissect the genetic basis of these traits using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). This work has been accepted for publication at Genetics; I am co-first author with Pip Wilson and Jared Streich, having lead many genomic analyses. In Chapter 6, I perform a study of landscape genomic variation in two woodland eucalypt species. Using whole genome sequencing of around 200 individuals from around 20 localities of both E. albens and E. sideroxylon, I find incredible genetic diversity and low genome-wide inter-species differentiation.I find no support for strong discrete population structure, but strong support for isolation by (geographic) distance (IBD). Using generalised dissimilarity modelling, I further examine the pattern of IBD, and establish additional isolation by environment (IBE). E. albens shows moderately strong IBD, explaining 26% of deviance in genetic distance using geographic distance, and an additional 6% deviance explained by incorporating environmental predictors (IBE). E. sideroxylon shows much stronger IBD, with 78% of deviance explained by geography, and stronger IBE (12% additional deviance explained).

Understanding the conservation status of taxonomic groups provides a systematic way to prioritize efforts to combat biodiversity loss. The 405 species within the order Clupeiformes are the herrings, shads, sardines, anchovies, menhadens and relatives that include many of the most important marine forage fishes. These small, schooling fishes are economically, ecologically and culturally significant globally. Despite their contribution to global fisheries and our increasing reliance on these fishes for food and industrial commodities, they are generally poorly known with limited information regarding basic biology and population trends. I applied IUCN Red List methodology, a comprehensive and systematic approach to assessing extinction risk of species, to all clupeiform species. I then used these assessments to synthesize and address their global conservation status and to highlight the potential for improvements to conservation and fisheries management. The best estimate of nearly 11% of species are of elevated conservation concern, although this could be as high as 34% if Data Deficient species are all threatened. The Caribbean and the Indo-Malay-Philippine Archipelago both have high concentrations of either threatened or Data Deficient species and are areas of particular conservation concern. Major threats include exploitation, pollution and habitat modification for human use although the intensity of a specific threat differs between freshwater, estuarine and marine environments. Life history and ecological traits of threatened and Near Threatened species were characterized between primary habitat systems. Immediate conservation priorities include: 1) the evaluation of current fisheries management strategies, with a strong recommendation toward ecosystem-based management protocols that incorporate group-specific life history traits, and 2) local, intensive habitat restoration to reduce pollution and remove dams. These extinction risk assessments and subsequent analyses should be used to monitor conservation progress and as an informative tool for fisheries and conservation managers.",2019-12,9/1/2023 0:52,9/1/2023 1:02,9/1/2023 0:52,,114,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Old Dominion University,United States -- Virginia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,M.S.,,,,,ISBN: 9781392539538,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\P72R4JVE\Birge - Global Conservation Status and Threat Patterns of .pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; OZCAM

Previous research suggests Vallisneria is a more speciose genus than current taxonomy indicates, and there remains contention on the level of species diversity within the genus. In order to address some of these taxonomic issues, this study estimates phylogenetic relationships within the genus using a previously published molecular dataset augmented with previously unsampled species. Maximum likelihood analyses were employed for all molecular data partitions (e.g., nrITS, cpDNA, and combined nuclear and cpDNA datasets) resulting in an updated hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships within the genus. An ancestral state reconstruction was estimated for the two growth habits shown within Vallisneria (caulescent and rosulate). Additionally, information on the historical biogeography was pulled from previous research to estimate the geographic origin for Vallisneria and to estimate dispersal events within the evolutionary history of the genus. Based on our findings, we recommend the resurrection of two Vallisneria species (V. gracilis and V. neotropicalis), and formally recognize and describe a new species (V. jacobsii sp. provis.). Morphological data was shown to be useful for species delimitation, but many features were inconsistent or provided too much phenotypic plasticity for use in phylogenetic reconstruction, despite the utilization of a common garden experiment. We also show the presence of naturally occurring Vallisneria hybrids within Northern Territory, Australia, and give conclusive evidence that non-native hybrids are being used for a restoration project in Crystal River, Florida. Pertinent literature is reviewed over the following topics: angiosperm evolution and the occurrence of aquatic plants, systematics of Hydrocharitaceae and Vallisneria, taxonomy, and ecology.",2022,13/2/2023 23:47,14/2/2023 1:12,13/2/2023 23:47,,74,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,University of Kansas,United States -- Kansas,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,M.A.,,,,,ISBN: 9798368480503 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\DYLBBCMP\Martin and Link to external site - 2022 - A Deep Dive into the Aquatic Plant Genus Vallisner.pdf,,check if available ⏳

All genera are arranged in alphabetical order within families and all species are arranged in alphabetical order within genera. To avoid any unnecessary duplication and to ensure that the abbreviated descriptions provide as much information as possible, the descriptions of families, genera and species are constructed on a comparative, hierarchical basis, i.e. each description is diagnostic only within the next highest taxonomic category. In this way all genera within a particular family can usually be compared, character for character, so that essential differences between them are obvious. Similarly, the descriptions of all species within a particular genus can be compared to find both differences and similarities. Critical features used to distinguish only one or two individual genera or species may not be included in their general descriptions but will be used in the key(s) in which they occur. For this reason the keys can be used to search quickly for diagnostic differences between similar species, without having to work through an entire key to make or confirm an identification. The combination of characters given in any description is therefore characteristic only of the family, genus or species being described. This means that any individual possessing this combination of characters can only, at least in theory, belong to this particular taxon. However, this unique suite of characters holds true only within the next highest taxonomic category. In some cases, where two or more species are similar in nearly all respects, only one may be described fully, with only those features distinguishing the other(s) from this species being described. Two corollaries of this hierarchical structure are that (a) the descriptions of species in different genera (even where these genera may be closely related) may not be directly comparable and (b) the full diagnostic description of any one species consists not only of the characters cited in the species description, but also those which go to make up the generic and family descriptions. But additional diagnostic profiles of a genus or species can be created from its relevant key, even if the key isn't being used to make the identification. This useful method and its application are demonstrated elsewhere in the Introduction under the section Making an Identification (see p. 11). The size of any given species is given in different ways for different groups: for frogs, a single, unqualified measurement is given at the end of each description; this is the average adult body length of the species unless any comment is made to the contrary. For lizards, the average adult length is usually expressed as snout-vent length. Because many lizards may lose and regenerate their tails, knowledge of total length has little practical advantage in identification. Exceptions are indicated, while relative tail length is provided where this information is important in identification. For snakes, two measurements are sometimes given - the average adult total length and the approximate maximum total length. This latter measurement is provided because it is so often requested, especially in relation to potentially dangerous species.",2014,14/2/2023 3:03,14/2/2023 3:09,14/2/2023 1:15,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,CSIRO Publishing,"Collingwood, Australia",English,,,,,,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\BCHZTFRL\Cogger - 2014 - Reptiles and Amphibians.pdf,,check if available ⏳

Alternate abstract: With scientific collections bringing together a huge number and diversity of objects and the data associated with them, they constitute a valuable historical, scientific and cultural heritage. These collections are generally under the responsibility of museums and their respective curators, and it is important that there is a platform on which those responsible for them can carry out management and maintenance operations. Given the diversity of the collections, these data, belonging to different scientific domains and with different properties, pose problems of integration, availability and maintenance, problems that are increasingly relevant in a data-centric world that relies on the analysis and sharing of the data. This project, focused on this challenge, aimed to develop, for the Museu Nacional de Historia Natural e da Ciencia da Universidade de Lisboa, a platform that aggregates the very diverse collections of this institution, taking advantage of an open-source base platform called CollectiveAccess. In the course of the same, a generalized methodology was developed for any collection, covering the processes from the acquisition of the data, its processing and correction to its import and availability within the platform. Specific features were also developed and implemented that aimed at solving certain particular characteristics of different data sets, such as the implementation of a hierarchical system for taxonomyrelated data, geographic data entry system using an external API and development of the base search features, meeting the requirements for each collection. These functionalities and the overall performance of the system were evaluated through two usability questionnaires (System Usability Scale), via two different Google Forms.

Rapid, cost-effective and reliable monitoring of biodiversity is essential for the conservation of the exceptional biotic richness within this region. The emerging field of environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring, using trace cells or<br/>fragments of DNA released into an environment to assign species to locations has potential to provide this type of information.<br/>In this thesis, I explore the use of eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring freshwater aquatic biodiversity within Southeast Asia, focusing on fishes within the lakes of the Malay Archipelago. Firstly, I co-led to a published review of the field of eDNA in which we discuss how the field has developed, address current challenges, and predict future developments. Secondly, I conducted sampling of lakes across the Malaysian Peninsula as an initial exploration into the use of eDNA in tropical freshwaters using the ethanol precipitation method of environmental DNA collection, as well as conducted a mesocosm experiment to<br/>test eDNA degradation. Thirdly, after initial trouble shooting, I tested options for isolation and storage of aquatic eDNA to inform best practice solutions for eDNA field researchers, and found that the use of an enclosed filter system combined with a preservation buffer was the best approach. Fourthly, I conducted intensive sampling of a lake in Indonesia to investigate the dynamics of eDNA information within a tropical lentic environment, and found heterogenous detection of extant biodiversity. Finally, I undertook a large-scale biogeography study of the lakes of the Malay Archipelago, sampling from western Sumatra across to eastern Sulawesi using a filter approach for environmental DNA collection.<br/>Metabarcoding of aquatic eDNA samples was then employed for all samples, with a combination of primers targeting different mitochondrial regions to achieve a broad scope of biodiversity information. From the data, I recovered native, endemic and rare species, as well as introduced and invasive species linked to fisheries, aquaculture, the ornamental trade and pest-control. Overall, aquatic eDNA metabarcoding demonstrated great potential, allowing<br/>ecosystem level species detection, but further work on eDNA distribution, improvements to barcoding capabilities and the reliability of quantification, will greatly deepen the possibilities presented by aquatic eDNA metabarcoding in advancing wildlife and biodiversity monitoring in tropical habitats.",2019,7/3/2023 7:31,24/3/2023 3:10,7/3/2023 7:31,,428,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Bangor University (United Kingdom),Wales,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798684641794,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\FN8F8Q6M\Evans_Exploring the Biodiversity of the Lakes of the Malay Archipelago Using.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

Their spore-forming inner tissue, called gleba, is protected by sterile outer layers comprising the peridium. After maturation, the spores are not forcibly discharged, but passively released from the basidium and dispersed by environmental factors, due to the loss of ballistospory. For a long time the species with enclosed basidiomata have been included in a separate class - Gasteromycetes (Fries 1821, Cunningham 1944, Ahmad 1952, Pilat 1958, Coker & Couch 1974, Bo 1984, etc.). However, some mycologists strongly doubted that the class Gasteromycetes really comprised the natural group of fungi (Heim 1971). Multiple molecular phylogenetic studies supported the notion that gasteroid fungi represent an artificial assemblage of polyphyletic taxa (Hibbett et al. 1997, Miller et al. 2001, Binder & Bresinsky 2002, Binder & Hibbett 2006, Hosaka et al. 2006, Wilson et al. 2011). For the sake of convenience, they are still being informally grouped as gasteroid fungi, or gasteroid basidiomycetes (Pegler et al. 1995). The species formerly classified as ""Gasteromycetes"" are now included in the class Agaricomycetes. The majority of gasteroid taxa were distributed among the subclasses Agaricomycetidae and Phallomycetidae, however, the order Russulales, which contains gasteroid members, was not placed in either of the subclasses and remained incertae sedis (Hibbett et al. 2007). Despite the fact that gasteroid forms comprise only 8.4 % of the total number of species belonging to the Agaricomycetes (Kirk et al. 2001), their diverse appearances, nutritional strategies and habitats make gasteroid basidiomycetes unique in terms of their variability. Also, a rather small fraction of gasteroid species from the whole number of taxa within the class can be explained by the notion, that many gasteroid lineages are relatively young and have not reached their equilibrium (Wilson et al. 2011). The gasteroid fungi are distributed worldwide and can be found in all climatic zones. Among the representatives of gasteroid basidiomycetes, there are epigeous and hypogeous fungi, saprotrophs and species forming mycorrhizae, edible mushrooms, along with species, possessing medicinal properties. Many members of gasteroid fungi have a long-standing tradition in folk medicine, as well as a rich folklore heritage in different cultures all over the world (Pegler et al. 1995). Numerous drugs and biologically active substances demonstrating antitumor, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulation activities are obtained from representatives of this group (Liu & Zhang 2004, Knag et al. 2007, Guzman 2008, Coetzee & Van Wyk 2009, Sharvit et al. 2012). However, data on biodiversity, distribution, ecology, systematics, morphology, anatomy, cultural peculiarities and phylogeny of gasteroid basidiomycetes are often insufficient and sometimes even controversial. Although the importance of detailed investigations of gasteroid basidiomycetes is widely acknowledged, these fungi are among the most poorly studied members of the Israeli mycobiota. Given all this, investigations of biodiversity and distribution of gasteroid basidiomycetes in Israel, as well as the phylogenetic relationships within the family Lycoperdaceae, based on analysis derived from both macro- and micromorphology of the gasterocarps, culturalmorphological peculiarities, and molecular phylogenetic reconstructions, will provide new insight, first of all, into species diversity of ""Gasteromycetes"" in Israel, as well as their biology and taxonomic issues pertaining to the family Lycoperdaceae.

While there has been an increase in interest regarding different forms of AusE speech variation over the past 40 years, the consensus of AusE linguistic research still lies with an approach that focuses on social varieties (roughly determined by social class) and downplays regional variation. This focus on social variation, pioneered by Mitchell and Delbridge (1965a), has dominated AusE linguistics for the past 60 years. As Australia has grown as a nation, this has led to a mismatch between folk-linguistic perceptions of AusE variation and linguistic analysis of AusE production. Folk-linguistic perceptions help to paint a much more complex picture of AusE by comparing folk-linguistic beliefs and experiences with linguistic understandings and expertise. This thesis is an attempt to further the field of AusE dialectology through an examination of folk-linguistic perceptions. This thesis seeks to examine the following questions: 1. Do non-linguist native speakers of AusE perceive speech differences across Australia? 2. How has AusE dialectology changed since the formative work of Bryant (1992)? 3. Can the study of AusE dialectology benefit from the inclusion of folklinguistic perceptions of AusE variation? The significance of this thesis lies in its breadth of methods and focus. No study has gathered and compared both attitudinal and dialectological data across every state in Australia. This study aims to widen the research into variation in AusE by demonstrating the sociocultural relevance of including speaker perceptions as part of the larger understanding of language varieties.",2019,7/3/2023 2:57,7/3/2023 6:12,7/3/2023 2:57,,1221,,,NA,,Mapping Australian English,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798738615535,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\L647RB8W\Kingstone_2019_Mapping Australian English.pdf,,2 - ALA cited; Map
8QCP26IE,report,2022,"Waycott, Michelle; Lewis, Ryan",A restoration strategy for the Ruppia Community of the southern Coorong,,,,,,"The Healthy Coorong, Healthy Basin program aims to improve ecological health of the Coorong and is committed to delivering outcomes that can be supported by an evidence base and adoption pathway such as this strategy describes. The goal of this strategy is to support ongoing management of the aquatic macrophyte community, the Ruppia Community, in the southern Coorong through evaluating restoration options. This technical report is structured as a stand-alone document, containing; an introduction and background to the southern Coorong and its aquatic macrophyte community and a review of restoration approaches in other systems where submerged aquatic macrophyte communities were impacted (Chapter 1); a case study from previous Coorong Ruppia Community restoration activities that provides context and insights that inform the restoration strategy (Chapter 2); and a detailed strategy for decision-making and management of future restoration activities (Chapters 3 & 4). The restoration objective is to restore a resilient Ruppia Community with widespread populations of high abundance relative to prevailing conditions.

XCVUI4RD,thesis,2022,"Subasinghe, Kalya",Avian Morphometrics and Climate Change,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2778642621/abstract/DE607ABBD8B34AA8PQ/1,"Climate has changed rapidly since the end of 19th century due to increased emission of greenhouse gases into the earth's atmosphere. These changes have resulted in species changing their distributions and their phenology. Recent studies have also demonstrated that climate change underlies changes to morphological traits in endotherms. Climate related variations in morphological traits across geographic space have long been recognized. For instance, Bergman's and Allen's rule describe latitudinal patterns in morphological traits; larger body sizes and smaller appendage sizes relative to body size in colder, higher latitudes. One explanation for these rules is based on the heat exchange capacity of the trait and its adaptiveness to the thermal environment. Recent studies on morphological responses to climate change mostly focused on changes to body size and there is little understanding of what other morphological traits are responding to climate change and which particular changes in climate the morphological traits are sensitive to. In my thesis, I focused on birds in the Australasian group Meliphagides, and investigated how their bills, which are a structure important in heat exchange, have responded to changes in climate in recent years. In Chapter 2, I used microCT technology to confirm that the formula for surface area of a cone is a valid proxy for measurement of bill surface area. This formula was used to estimate bill size of individuals used in this study i.e. 9847 museum specimens of Meliphagides from 79 species. In Chapter 3, I examined the geographic patterns of bill size and then its associations with climate to generate predictions on bill size response to climate change. I extended the conventional modelling to include temperature extremes associated with physiological limits related to thermal performance, as well as other climate variables that may influence thermoregulation of endotherms such as humidity and rainfall. Latitudinal patterns of bill size conformed to Allen's rule with large bill sizes in warmer low latitudes. I found a significant interaction between frequency of exposure to summer extremes (days≥35°C) with rainfall and humidity, with large bill sizes in hot, dry and, hot, humid environments, which most likely optimizes thermal performance via improving dry heat loss. However, the non-linear association between bill size and summer extremes indicated that bills are small in populations that are frequently exposed to summer extremes, possibly a mechanism to balance heat loads at temperatures exceeding body temperature. The significant interaction between winter extremes (days <5°C) and winter rainfall indicated that the bills are small in populations in cold wet environments, which is most likely an adaptation to reduce heat loss at colder temperatures. In Chapter 4, I showed that changes in temperature extremes that cause changes to thermoregulatory demands drive recent changes in bill size of Meliphagides, in line with the predictions based on spatial patterns. I demonstrated that the bill size response may vary in terms of both magnitude and direction based on the local climate experienced by the population and other environmental perturbations, such as landscape change. In Chapter 5, I investigated the associations between bill size change, and species' traits and found no evidence of strong associations between them. Only 11.1% of variation in bill size change observed was explained by species' traits, suggesting that other factors such as differences in climate exposure may account for morphological responses to climate change. Overall, my thesis contributes evidence to show morphological traits other than body size are responding to climate change, specifically changes in temperature extremes that known to cause changes to thermoregulatory demands. However, whether this change represents a genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity is yet to be explored.",2022,7/3/2023 3:31,7/3/2023 3:33,7/3/2023 3:31,,190,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798371939203,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\EJ5P3TQT\Subasinghe_2022_Avian Morphometrics and Climate Change.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records
GYJT58VR,thesis,2022,"Noble, Mae Marjorie",Integrating Social-Ecological Values into Marine Protected Area Spatial Planning,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2778644592/abstract/973B4BBD823F40CAPQ/1,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are useful tools for balancing complex social-ecological interactions and human demands on marine ecosystems when the overall intention is to support long-term social-ecological resilience. Historically, the design of MPAs have been skewed towards ecological values and principles, but recently focus has widened to the identification, protection, and inclusion of the social and economic values of key stakeholders into marine protected area spatial planning. However, there are very few applied studies to date that have achieved this, and included a wide range of stakeholder groups. Even rarer has been the integration of ecological spatial with this social data to create holistic snapshots of social and ecological assets for modelling MPA design vulnerability and adaptation. Using the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP) in New South Wales (NSW) Australia as a case study, this PhD research was grounded in social-ecological theoretical principles that utilised mixed-methods participatory mapping interviews with a diversity of stakeholder groups. These groups spanned commercial and recreational fishers, Aboriginal Traditional Owners, tourism business operators, non-government organisations (NGOs), scientists, and marine resource managers. Data were analysed using novel combinations of fuzzy-set GIS multi-criteria evaluation methods and network analyses to develop a spatial representation and in-depth analysis of stakeholder uses, values, and ecological knowledge. These outputs were then used to assess how the current MPA spatial plan supports social-ecological objectives, and make predictions of how the current plan may support long-term social-ecological resilience. The overall objective of this research thesis was to create a balanced social-ecological spatial understanding of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) as a model for expanding the values on which to develop equitable spatial management plans to support social-ecological resilience. To meet this overall objective, there were four aims that have each been written as standalone peer-reviewed articles using data collected in interviews with stakeholders. These aims were to: 1) identify the key knowledge gaps within social-ecological marine spatial planning using a literature review, 2) create a spatial understanding of the social context and dynamics of an MPA, 3) collate and develop a high-quality spatial ecological understanding of an MPA, and 4) integrate social and ecological into a predictive analysis of how a spatial management plan can support long-term social-ecological resilience in a coastal ecosystem. Collectively, these individual published chapters and the overarching theoretical outcomes of this thesis provide a novel spatial modelling method used to represent key biodiversity values and a diversity of stakeholder uses and values. The method demonstrates that MPAs within Australia and around the world are needed to protect marine ecosystems alongside supporting the social and economic needs of people who depend on their marine environments for their livelihoods and wellbeing. Outcomes of this thesis research have been applied to the review of the PSGLMP management plan, which is a pilot for assessment of better management of the NSW coastal MPAs under the NSW Marine Estate Management Strategy (2018-2028). Future priorities arising from this research include testing the method on MPAs across Australia, development of the GIS models to include greater integration of freshwater social-ecological influences, and developing these frameworks into three-dimensional models that better reflect cultural understandings and marine ecosystem processes. Overall, the outcomes of this research reflect the cultural importance and depth of knowledge of stakeholders of the marine environment, which needs to be respected and supported through the development of balanced MPAs that support social-ecological resilience.",2022,7/3/2023 3:25,7/3/2023 3:29,7/3/2023 3:25,,266,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798371943644,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\4HIGYHJN\Noble_2022_Integrating Social-Ecological Values into Marine Protected Area Spatial Planning.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Species occurrence records; Modelling

Field trials were carried out at the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, Oyo state and the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM), Kwara state during 2021 cropping season. The aim of the study was to examine the growth and yield of sorghum cultivars as influenced by population density of components soybeans. The full population of sorghum cultivars (samsorg 47, samsorg 48, and samsorg 49) was intercropped with 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% full population of soybean. The sole crop of both sorghum and soybeans were the checks. The experiment was laid out as a 4 x 3 factorial filled into randomized complete block design (RCBD) in split plot with three replicates. The population density constitutes the main plots while sorghum cultivars were the sub-plot treatments. The seed weight and head length of sorghum cultivars were not influenced by population density of component soybean. Sole sorghum out-yielded the intercropped and decreased as the population of component soybean decreased. The number of branches, pods and seed per plant of soybeans were significantly higher at the sole compared to the intercropped. A significantly lower number pods 18.93 and 32.48 and seeds 7.92 and 6.89 per plant respectively for LAUTECH and NCAM were recorded where full populations of both crops were intercropped. Irrespective of cultivars and locations, the lowest grain yield of sorghum was obtained at the population ratio 100SH:100SO whereas the highest grain yields of soybean was recorded at the 100SH:25SO population ratio. Regardless of sorghum cultivar, a higher intercropping advantage was observed at 100SH:100SO and 100SH:100SO population ratios.

One possible explanation is the persistence of organisms in refugia, areas of stability that allow taxa to persist during times of unfavourable climate, with the potential to expand from there in later times. In this dissertation, I explore measures of refugia and stability, and the contribution of refugia to the diversity patterns of lizards in the Australian Monsoonal Tropics. Stability and refugia are widely used concepts in macroecology and biogeography, but their use is not always clearly defined. In Chapter 1 I present a conceptual framework for thinking through concepts of stability, focusing on five key questions. Thinking through these questions provides a clear understanding of any definition of stability, assisting with comparing studies and interpreting the biological implications of their results. In Chapter 2 I empirically test the importance of using this framework, comparing four different measures of stability to see which best predicts reptile diversity in the Australian Monsoonal Tropics. I find large differences in the performances of the stability measures, demonstrating the importance of carefully considering the biological meaning of stability measures before including them in studies. Chapter 3 investigates drivers of diversity patterns across the Australian Monsoonal Tropics, including stability as well as current climate, geology and disturbance. Finally, in the fourth chapter I explore the impact of refugia on the biogeography of lizards in the Kimberley region. I test refugia across different spatial scales (fine and coarse grain) and temporal scales (Holocene and Pleistocene) to examine the drivers of diversity patterns in the region.",2020,7/3/2023 3:18,24/3/2023 4:14,7/3/2023 3:18,,144,,,NA,,Refugia in the Australian Monsoonal Tropics,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798691221873,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\MCKMGSEX\McDonald-Spicer_Refugia in the Australian Monsoonal Tropics.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Modelling

This position has been found to be problematic as ecological science has not vindicated the ecological community as an entity which can be stable or coherent. Ecological communities do not form natural kinds, and this has forced ecological scientists to explain ecology in a different manner. Individualist approaches to ecological systems have gained prominence. Individualists claim that ecological systems are better explained at the population level rather than as whole communities. My thesis looks at the implications of the current state of ecological science on conservation biology and emphasizes the importance of biodiversity as assessed at the population level. I defend the position that biodiversity should represent taxonomy and be quantified in reference to phylogenetic structure. This is a defence of biodiversity realism, which conceives of biodiversity as a natural quantity in the world which is measurable, valuable to prudent agents, and causally salient to ecological systems. To address how biodiversity at the population level relates to larger ecological systems I create a methodology designed to identify the relevant ecological system which biodiversity maintains and is maintained by biodiversity. This is done through the context dependent modelling of causal networks indexed to populations. My causal modelling methodology is then utilized to explicate ecological functions. These chapters together provide a framework for conservation science, which can then be applied to novel problems. The final section of the thesis utilises this framework to address whether de-extinction is a worthwhile conservation technique.",2019,7/3/2023 2:54,7/3/2023 2:55,7/3/2023 2:54,,258,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798494433510,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\2ZGEN625\Lean_2019_Ecological Kinds and the Units of Conservation.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned

These changes have left lasting impressions on the diversity, richness, and distribution of earth's inhabitants. Identifying evolutionary commonalities as a result of these events is one of the main aims of the field of macroevolution. It is also the main theme that unites my thesis: investigating the influence of changes to the Australian climate and landscape on the organisms which call Australia home. Empirically, this has required extensively sampling Australian vertebrate groups for phylogenetic, distributional, ecological, and morphological trait data. Methodologically, this has required implementing and building phylogenetic comparative methods to better understand the diversity that surrounds us. As a continent, Australia gained its independence somewhere between 40-30 million years ago when it separated from Antarctica and began drifting north towards Asia. Prior to this, the Australian plate existed alongside South America, Africa, and India, as part of the supercontinent Gondwana. In the intervening millions of years, Australia has remained isolated, and so even comparatively recent immigrant lineages have speciatedin situ, resulting in a number of iconic endemic terrestrial vertebrate radiations. These radiations are great for comparative studies because they provide replicated groups which have diversified under similar environmental influences. Importantly though, they differ in absolute diversity, ecology, and behavior. My research has investigated how changes due to the isolation of the Australian plate, continental aridification, and grassland expansion have impacted the Australian fauna. In my opening chapter I discuss how the separation of Australia from Antarctica may have precipitated a mass extinction event in a relatively understudied group of lizards, the pygopodoid geckos. Next I present evidence that the Miocene aridification of Australia likely reduced the rate of phenotypic evolution of terrestrial vertebrates by facilitating allopatric speciation and niche conservatism. In the following chapter I test the hypothesis that the diversification of macropod marsupials is linked to the Plio-Pleistocene expansion of C4 grasses. Finally, I present the idea that the immense disparity in body size of Australian varanid lizards is the result of character displacement and competition occurring on a continental scale. Ultimately, the inferences we can draw about evolutionary changes occurring on deep time scales are exciting because they are often intuitive. In no place else does this seem truer than in Australia, which is a natural laboratory for macroevolutionary studies.",2019,7/3/2023 2:31,7/3/2023 2:51,7/3/2023 2:31,,218,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798494433015,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\CI6L5C8X\Brennan_2019_Macroevolution across a Changing Australian Landscape.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records
9VTUBNHD,thesis,2015,"Khoury, Colin K.",The Conservation and Use of Crop Genetic Resources for Food Security,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2564078657/abstract/CFBF8CD7CD1240DBPQ/1,"Crop genetic diversity is a critical resource to address the nutrition and agronomic challenges facing global food security. Increases in use of this diversity are expected but are dependent upon conservation, availability, and access. Considerable erosion of crop genetic diversity has occurred in situ, i.e., in farmers' fields and natural habitats, and the variation conserved in ex situ genebanks is also vulnerable due to insufficient resources. The window of opportunity to resolve these deficiencies and thus accomplish a comprehensive global system for crop genetic diversity conservation and availability for use will not remain open indefinitely. Among the factors hindering the conservation of crop genetic resources is a lack of essential information regarding this diversity. Questions include: (a) what is the status of diversity in our food systems, and where are the greatest vulnerabilities?, (b) where can genetic diversity be found that can be useful in increasing productivity and mitigating these vulnerabilities?, (c) is this genetic diversity available in the present and in the long term?, and (d) what steps are needed to improve the ability for researchers to access genetic resources critical for present and future crop improvement? This thesis aims to contribute to the knowledge required to answer these questions through an exploration of the need for, potential of, challenges and constraints regarding, and necessary steps to enhance the conservation and use of crop genetic diversity. The research starts with an investigation of the state of diversity in global food supplies, finding that national food supplies around the world have become increasingly similar over the past 50 years, gaining in calories, protein, and fat, as animalderived foods and high-calorie plant foods have risen in importance. The proportion of diets consisting of major cereals, sugar crops and oil crops has increased, while regionally and locally important cereals, root crops, and oil crops have generally become further marginalized. The thesis then delves into the potential for utilization of a particular set of genetic resources of increasing interest globally - crop wild relatives. These wild cousins of cultivated species have been used for many decades for crop improvement. Their utilization is likely only to increase due to improvements in information on species and their diversity, advancements in breeding tools, and the growing need for exotic genetic diversity in order to address compounding agronomic challenges. As wild plants they are subject to a myriad of human caused threats to natural ecosystems. A focus on wild genetic resources is thus timely both for biodiversity conservation and food security objectives.Research on crop wild relatives first concentrated on the identification of potentially important wild genetic resources at the national level in the United States. The resulting National Inventory listed close to 5000 taxa. A prioritization of species based on value to food security emphasized close to 300 native taxa that are most closely related to important food crops. Once potentially valuable genetic resources are identified, subsequent information is needed regarding where they occur, what diversity they may possess, and how well conserved and therefore available to crop breeders they are. A 'gap analysis' methodology was proposed to answer these questions, capitalizing on developments in digital occurrence and eco-geographic data as well as species distribution modeling, intentionally utilizing freely available software and data, and incorporating a novel expert evaluation tool. The thesis then advances the gap analysis methodology, taking advantage of improvements in species targeting, occurrence data, modeling, and expert feedback methods, and further utilizing eco-geographic information to identify traits of value to crop improvement objectives. In case studies on the wild relatives of bean (Phaseolus L.), sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., I. series Batatas], and pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.], related species were found to be highly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems and thus inadequately available to breeders and researchers. Species differed among themselves and in comparison to the associated crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation, and edaphic characteristics, and many species also showed considerable intraspecific variation. Taxa and specific geographic locations were prioritized for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of germplasm collections for these important crops. While conservation of crop genetic diversity is fundamental to the availability of this diversity for breeding, it is national and international policies that determine the real capacity for researchers to acquire these resources. The thesis culminates in an exploration of the degree to which international collaboration is required in order to achieve access to genetic resources where they are needed. Countries were found to be highly dependent on crops whose genetic diversity largely sources from outside their borders. This reliance is evident even in countries located in regions of high indigenous crop diversity and has increased significantly over the past half century, bolstering evidence for the need for effective national and international policies to promote genetic resource conservation and exchange.",2015,7/3/2023 2:22,24/3/2023 3:31,7/3/2023 2:22,,316,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Wageningen University and Research,Netherlands,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798516047343,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\UGHNMZ4D\Khoury_The Conservation and Use of Crop Genetic Resources for Food Security.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records

Biosecurity and weed threats to New South Wales primary industries,,,,,,"Climate change in Australia is likely to result in increased temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and a higher frequency of extreme climate events. An extensive review of 3280+ papers for the key terms 'climate change modelling' found that only 24 specifically examined weeds, almost all relevant to New South Wales (NSW) (Darbyshire et al. 2022). Based on these findings, the NSW Department of Primary Industries Vulnerability Assessment project is developing a series of Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) models to investigate the impact of climate change on two significant weeds, serrated tussock and parthenium weed. Published literature and expert opinion were used to inform the development of these models. The process identified the key climatic variables (e.g. temperature, rain) for each life stage in the growth cycle. This data was then used to create the MCA hierarchical structure that underpins the climate suitability model. The model captures the extent to which the climate conditions satisfy seedling and reproductive growth requirements without considering other factors like management decisions, soil, and irrigation. The climate suitability was then mapped for NSW using historical climate data from 1970 to 2019 (50-years). The maps indicate areas of high and low climate suitability for the weeds. Data was extracted for incursion sites and established areas allowing the user to view the annual changes in climate suitability in NSW to validate the model. Current and future statewide climate suitability maps will be used to identify research, management and adaptation priorities that can be used strategically by industry, government and community to enhance weed risk assessment and management in NSW.",1/1/2022,27/3/2023 5:12,27/3/2023 7:13,27/3/2023,,,,,NA,,What is your state of vulnerability to climate change?,,NA,NA,,Department of Primary Industries,Australia,not specified,,,,,ResearchGate,,,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\LWCSQTNL\Johnson et al_2022_What is your state of vulnerability to climate change.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map; Modelling
C7C7Y7ET,thesis,2022,"Zabala, Jorge Andres Perez","Taxonomic Diversity, Phylogeny, and Diversification of the Environmental Niche of the Genus Prunus L. with Emphasis on the New World Tropics",,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2788335462/abstract/65636E4CCBB74D36PQ/1,"The occurrence and diversity of Prunus outside of temperate North America and Eurasia has been frequently overlooked. Particularly, the Neotropics has been the region where the taxonomic knowledge of the genus was weaker with just few reports of new species and only one historical revision (Koehne, 1915). A taxonomic synopsis of all the evergreen taxa of Prunus currently in the Americas is presented in chapter 1 based on an exhaustive specimen revision comprising 8322 individual specimens (duplicates) corresponding to 4146 distinct botanical records housed in 94 herbaria from the Americas and Europe. A total of 246 taxa of Prunus (all with racemose inflorescences) comprising 227 species (plus the generally naturalized or cultivated P. serotina) were identified in the New World. 97 taxa with already published legitimate basionyms were accepted (out of a total 110 basionyms) and 149 taxa were identified as taxonomic novelties. After these results, the genus, traditionally considered a typical temperate taxon, now amounts its highest diversity in the tropics and particularly in the New World side. The higher number of novelties were found in the Andes, a region with a considerable environmental diversity but also with most of its ecosystems highly fragmented and adversely impacted by human activities. As part of the taxonomic studies, a full taxonomic treatment of the species of Mesoamerica was done in chapter 2 derived and complemented from a published Spanish version created during this research (Perez-Zabala, 2015). Most of the species in Mesoamerica were previously known only by one or few specimens and since non taxonomic revision had been previously done, most specimens in herbaria (the larger portion collected in the last 40 years) remained as unidentified or misidentified. As a result, 31 species were identified and fully described for the region, including 3 cultivated and one commonly naturalized. Additionally, 11 species were recognized as novelties to science (yet to be published), lectotypes were designated for 5 species, and 4 previously published names were categorized as synonyms. Following this study, Prunus was confirmed as the more diverse genus of Rosaceae (among 20 genera) in Mesoamerica. In chapter 3, the phylogeny and evolution of the environmental niche in terms of the water regime preference was investigated across the genus considering a better representation of Neotropical species, a group that generally was absent or scarcely sampled in previous studies. Prunus, as an almost cosmopolitan group, exhibits a wide variety of habitat preference and many species are recognized because the tolerance to seasonality of water availability (by dryness or freeze), some with the ability to resist extreme conditions as desertic or high elevation places. In the Neotropics, even though many species are distributed in humid places, a considerable number also occupy geographic pockets of seasonally dry forest, rocky outcrops, and rain shadow patches. The best supported BEAST phylogeny suggested the split of the genus in two main clades similarly to previous studies. One comprising mostly deciduous species with solitary flower, corymbs, or racemes, plus some evergreen racemose but pubescent, leaf domatia-bearing, or with deciduous calyx. The other clade included the evergreen, glabrous and racemose species which are mostly tropical and marginally subtropical. The Neotropical species were recovered as polyphyletic with two small groups in the first clade and most of the species in a single clade within the evergreen racemose main clade. However, inconsistences between trees inferred from nuclear and plastid regions were observed as in other studies, which suggests ancient introgressions in the racemose lineages of the first clade. Evolution of hydraulic niche (in terms of aridity index) was significantly correlated with the phylogeny and main monophyletic groups have an identifiable range of hydraulic tolerance. The current geographic wide spread of the genus seems to be favored by a retention of tolerance to water stress which even so was not identified as an evolutionary limiting factor that impeded the adaptation to a wide variety of water regimes. Future studies about the evolution of geography, ecology and functional traits in Prunus should involve a greater number of tropical species considering the appreciable weight in its diversity. A better knowledge of the tropical species can effectively contribute to their conservation and additionally could contribute to improve the understanding of the response to environmental stress of economically appreciated species in cultivation.",2022,27/3/2023 5:44,27/3/2023 5:47,27/3/2023 5:44,,616,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,"University of California, Davis","California, United States of America",English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798377625612,NA,"C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\BJ5X769W\Zabala_2022_Taxonomic Diversity, Phylogeny, and Diversification of the Environmental Niche.pdf",,1 - ALA used; DELTA
K3L3MU6A,thesis,2022,"Freestone, Marc",Conservation of Prasophyllum - Understanding Orchid Mycorrhizal Fungi to Save Threatened Orchids from Extinction,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2787197030/abstract/C01BA84CF6F4512PQ/1,"The Orchidaceae are the world's second largest plant family and have a high proportion of species threatened due to anthropogenic impacts. For some threatened orchids, conservation through protection of habitat alone is unlikely to prevent extinction, and conservation translocation of plants grown ex situ represents one of the few options for recovery. However, many orchids are difficult to grow in cultivation, an issue complicated by their obligate reliance on orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) for seed germination in the wild. Prasophyllum is a large genus of endemic terrestrial orchids from southern Australia, and nearly one third of the genus is currently listed as threatened. However, attempts to grow Prasophyllum have been consistently unsuccessful, with seed rarely germinating, an issue that has hampered urgently-needed ex situ conservation efforts for this genus. Therefore, the overarching aim of this PhD was to facilitate improved ex situ conservation prospects for Prasophyllum, by exploring their relationship with OMF, seed viability and propagation methods. Chapter 1 (Annals of Botany, in press) explores the continental-scale diversity and distribution of Ceratobasidium OMF in Australia. Prasophyllum were known to associate primarily with Ceratobasidium OMF, and so we combined a review of published Australian Ceratobasidium OMF sequences, previously collected but unpublished Ceratobasidium sequence data from Australian orchids, and the results of a published continent-wide soil sequencing project. By comparing the distribution of OMF isolated from orchids, with their distribution in soils, we showed that Ceratobasidium OMF with cross-continental distributions are common in Australian soils and frequently have geographic ranges that exceed that of their host orchid species. Most OMF were distributed within southern Australia, although species distribution modelling revealed that several had distributions extending into the arid central or tropical northern parts of the continent, correlating with soil moisture and temperature variables. This illustrates the ability of Ceratobasidium fungi to tolerate an extraordinarily wide range of environmental conditions. Given the correlation of environmental variables with large-scale distribution patterns of Ceratobasidium OMF, and to better understand OMF communities within Prasophyllum, we examined the role of habitat in OMF associations in Chapter 2. Broad-scale sampling of 33 species across the Prasophyllum genus was undertaken across six broad habitat types. We show that habitat is a strong driver of OMF associations in Prasophyllum, supporting a growing body of evidence on the importance of habitat in driving OMF associations in terrestrial orchids. However, we could not confirm the presence of a persistent core of ubiquitous OMF in this study. Instead, the high incidence of habitat-specific OMF across orchid species, suggests that habitat-controlled OMF associations may contribute to niche differentiation among Prasophyllum species. Chapter 3 studied the temporal dynamics of Ceratobasidium OMF communities in Prasophyllum between adults and protocorms and throughout a growing season. We ask if turnover in OMF communities between ontogenetic stages and over a growing season are explained by patterns of OMF replacement through time. We sequenced OMF from roots and protocorms from in situ seed baits to show that three Prasophyllum species display different patterns of mycorrhizal associations.",2022,27/3/2023 5:47,27/3/2023 5:51,27/3/2023 5:47,,323,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,ProQuest,,ISBN: 9798374424454,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\72D64862\Freestone_2022_Conservation of Prasophyllum - Understanding Orchid Mycorrhizal Fungi to Save.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned
JD7J77Z4,thesis,2022,"Notarnicola, Rocco Fabrizio",Responses of an Alpine Plant to Warming Temperatures: From Plasticity to Molecular Pathways,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/docview/2787193682/abstract/99EBC082530D4B18PQ/1,"Rapid changes to climatic parameters, including temperature, pose substantial threat to species persistence and biodiversity. Climate warming has been more rapid in alpine systems than lowland environments, however studies of responses to high temperature stress in alpine plants are lacking; particularly transcriptomic and genomic studies are nearly absent. Being sessile, plants must respond and adapt to changing environmental conditions in situ. In this regard, phenotypic plasticity is described as a rapid and adaptive mechanism to respond to climate change, however many fundamental questions about plasticity are yet unsolved, including its genetic and molecular underpinnings. Answering said fundamental questions, such as whether plasticity is adaptive, will help us better understand which species can be resilient to climate change. The overall objectives of this thesis were to (1) characterize the plastic phenotypic response of the alpine herb Wahlenbergia ceracea to warming and heatwaves using a whole-of-life cycle approach to address fundamental questions about plasticity; and (2) to examine changes in gene expression in response to warmer temperatures as an intermediate component of the molecular basis of plasticity. To determine whether the alpine plant W. ceracea will be able to tolerate projected, future warmer temperatures and heatwaves I examine plasticity in a range of relevant traits in lineages (the group of half-siblings obtained with targeted crosses) from low and high elevation (Chapter 2). When grown under warmer temperatures, W. ceracea plants showed signs of acclimation by means of higher thermal tolerance (Tcrit) but this did not confer resilience to heatwaves. High- and low-elevation lines exhibited limited genetic variation in plasticity, suggesting canalisation of the plastic response. To assess the effect of warming on the seed size vs number trade-off and on germination responses, I conduct germination assays under relatively cool and warm temperatures using seeds produced by parental individuals grown under cool and warm temperatures (Chapter 3). The reductions in seed size and number in parents grown under warm temperatures resulted in the breakdown of the seed size vs number trade-off, but this did not affect germination, despite correlations of these seed traits with germination traits. Warming increased germination, particularly of larger seeds, but overall resulted in more than fourfold reduction in parental fitness. To investigate the molecular pathways regulated in response to temperature and involved in physiological acclimation, I examine the differential gene expression of tolerant and sensitive lines grown under cool and warm temperatures using RNA-seq (Chapter 4). Under warm growth temperatures, plants upregulated post-translational processes and downregulated processes related to photosynthesis. Interestingly, tolerant lines showed stronger downregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis light harvesting, electron transport chain and photosystem II repair/assembly. In Chapter 5 I bring together the previous chapters by linking gene expression to mean trait values and plastic changes therein. I found that co-expressed genes involved in photosynthetic processes were correlated with the physiological parameter Fv/Fm. Genes involved in cell wall and cytoskeleton organisation were correlated with the number of reproductive stems. My thesis represents one of the few works in plant ecology addressing intraspecific variation in plasticity and its relationship with fitness and transcriptomic regulation in a native plant. Overall, the results showed that significant plasticity in many traits did not confer resilience to warmer conditions, as fitness was substantially reduced. The transcriptomic analyses highlighted candidate genes potentially involved in photosynthetic acclimation as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, opening avenues for future research.",2022,27/3/2023 6:29,27/3/2023 7:01,27/3/2023 6:29,,251,,,NA,,Responses of an Alpine Plant to Warming Temperatures,,NA,NA,,The Australian National University (Australia),Australia,English,Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,Ph.D.,,,,,ISBN: 9798374424867,NA,C:\Users\KEL329\Zotero\storage\4KHSZL95\Notarnicola_2022_Responses of an Alpine Plant to Warming Temperatures.pdf,,2 - ALA cited

6VWEEQMI,report,2022,"Johnson, Stephen; Baker, Sarah; Davidson, Bill; Harris, Carol; Sinclair, Katrina; Wu, Hanwen; Bajwa, Ali",Making a difference to invasive grasses management on the ground,,,,,,"Exotic, invasive, perennial grasses including African lovegrass, Chilean needle grass and serrated tussock have significant impacts on primary production (livestock) systems, rural communities, and the environment. With prolific seed production and effective seed dispersal mechanisms, their spread to new areas continues mostly unabated. The dense growth habit of these grasses competes strongly with more desirable exotic and native pasture species, and negatively influences fire regimes, threatening ecosystem structure and function. Management of these widespread invasive grass weeds is difficult to achieve at a regional scale. Impacts include reduced carrying capacity associated with decreased pasture productivity and quality, and contamination of hides, and wool. Affected farming-dependent communities are impacted by the economic cost of these weeds, potentially reducing community resilience (associated with a loss of services and facilities; human and social capital). As part of a National Invasive Grasses Research, Development and Engagement Business Plan, New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) have established three sites in NSW for the demonstration of best management practice (BMP) of African lovegrass, Chilean needle grass, and serrated tussock in stage 1 of this plan. The second stage involves increasing the reach of the initial demonstration sites by working directly with land managers to establish 21 adaptation sites featuring co-designed BMP options for managing these invasive grasses. Formal and informal extension activities around these sites will raise land managers awareness of BMP options available to manage these weeds. These adaptation site networks will help build their knowledge, skills, and management practices invasive grasses on their properties. This staged demonstration and co-designed adaptation site approach is anticipated to accelerate uptake by land managers of effective BMP of difficult-to-control species, particularly these invasive grasses.",1/1/2022,27/3/2023 7:10,27/3/2023 7:14,,,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,,Department of Primary Industries,,English,,,,,ResearchGate,,,NA,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Johnson-23/publication/369064007_Making_a_difference_to_invasive_grasses_management_on_the_ground/links/6407fc5f574950594572b226/Making-a-difference-to-invasive-grasses-management-on-the-ground.pdf,2 - ALA cited

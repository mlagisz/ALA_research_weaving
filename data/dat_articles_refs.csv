The Granite Belt is the most northerly extent of the New England Tablelands bioregion and is an elevated region (mostly above 800 m) characterised by adamellite domes and tors. Records of odonate species were collated from our own observations, photographs and collecting activities, specimens in the Queensland Museum, and specimens from other Australian museum collections and observational records from the Atlas of Living Australia. To date, a total of 58 species of Odonata have been recorded from the Granite Belt, 19 species of damselflies from seven families and 39 species of dragonflies from six families. The odonate fauna of the Granite Belt has strong southern affinities with almost all of the region's species occurring in the southern half of the continent. In terms of their distributions in Queensland, a little over half the species recorded from the Granite Belt are widespread extending north into the tropics. Most of the remaining species are restricted to south-eastern Queensland with 13 species potentially restricted within Queensland to the Granite Belt which is the northernmost extent of their national ranges. Some of these restricted species are associated with riverine habitats but more are associated with swamps and wet heaths in the south-eastern parts of Girraween National Park. The long-term persistence of these species in Queensland is at risk due to rising temperatures, more severe and prolonged droughts and more severe and frequent fires due to climate change.",2020,2020-05-05 05:24:15,2021-04-06 05:13:11,,1,,1,47,,,,,,,,,,,,GS 2020,,-,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/JJ3IC2UX/Burwell et al. - 2020 - Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) of the Grani.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Due to different eco‐evolutionary processes, these highly biodiverse areas may harbour different amounts of ancient and recently diverged organisms (paleo‐ and neo‐endemism, respectively). Patterns of endemism still need to be measured at distinct phylogenetic levels for most clades and, consequently, little is known about the distribution, the age and the causes of such patterns. Here we tested for the presence of centres with high phylogenetic endemism (PE) in the highly diverse Neotropical snakes, testing the age of these patterns (paleo‐ or neo‐endemism), and the presence of PE centres with distinct phylogenetic composition. We then tested whether PE is predicted by topography, by climate (seasonality, stability, buffering and relictualness), or biome size. We found that most areas of high PE for Neotropical snakes present a combination of both ancient and recently diverged diversity, which is distributed mostly in the Caribbean region, Central America, the Andes, the Atlantic Forest and on scattered highlands in central Brazil. Turnover of lineages is higher across Central America, resulting in more phylogenetically distinct PE centres compared to South America, which presents a more phylogenetically uniform snake fauna. Finally, we found that elevational range (topographic roughness) is the main predictor of PE, especially for paleo‐endemism, whereas low paleo‐endemism levels coincide with areas of high climatic seasonality. Our study highlights the importance of mountain systems to both ancient and recent narrowly distributed diversity. Mountains are both museums and cradles of snake diversity in the Neotropics, which has important implications for conservation in this region.",2020,2021-04-06 03:27:02,2021-04-06 03:27:02,,328-339,,2,43,Ecography,,,,,,en,,,0acd7ba4-15df-37d9-94c9-77c18ebee21b,,Script,,10.1111/ecog.04815,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/H2D8PV9J/Azevedo et al. - 2020 - Museums and cradles of diversity are geographicall.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/ecog.04815,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0906-7590,1600-0587",0906-7590,Ecography,Wiley,2019-11-05,2019,Museums and cradles of diversity are geographically coincident for narrowly distributed Neotropical snakes,2021-02-04T14:14:13.986406,

Easily recognisable in the field fruit bodies and strict and steady fruiting period make this species an attractive model object for investigations of ecology of wood-inhabiting fungi. This fungus is rather common in Ukraine, but considered rare in many other European countries. To explore species biology in relation to its rarity issues, we analyzed substrate requirements and habitat supply for P. calyptratus in two sites in Eastern Ukraine, as well as monitored patterns of fruit body production in three large aspen stands over 6 years. In addition, patterns of mycelial presence of P. calyptratus mycelia were studied in living aspen trees using custom species-specific primers. Results Study demonstrates potential suitability of a wide range of life / decomposition stages of aspen or white poplar tree trunks for P. calyptratus. This window of suitability, however, is rather short: dying of freshly dead trees, rarely exceeding two years) regardless of tree age, volume, position or other parameters. Moreover, mycelium presence of P. calyptratus was detected in the living tissues of host trees. These findings supported hypotheses of early substrate colonization and latent mycelial development of P. calyptratus before the substrate reached a stage suitable for fructification. Conclusions Confirmed by a combination of fruit body survey and detection of mycelial DNA, P. calyptratus demonstrates an ecological strategy which combines both strict substrate requirements and rapid substrate turnover. We suppose that such a strategy may be widely distributed among wood-inhabiting agarics.",2020,2021-02-25 06:59:13,2021-02-25 06:59:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,d59cbc68-fb99-360c-ad3c-c9ab6b87a443,,Script,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-122044/v1,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/6MIF35C7/Prylutskyi et al. - 2020 - Narrow Substrate Requirements Alongside Rapid Subs.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Tryon investigated the patterns of neotropical fern diversity and discovered that sites of exceptional richness and endemism are found in five predominantly montane regions. Here, we revisit these sites with the aid of contemporary methodologies. We integrate phylogenetic, ecological, climatic, and occurrence data to better understand what factors contribute to the patterns of fern diversity throughout the neotropics. With this dataset we are able to reassess Tryon's neotropical hotspots fifty years later and take one step closer to understanding the processes governing the distribution of fern species. We recover six hotspots of neotropical species richness and endemism that closely mirror those delineated by Tryon. Like Tryon, we find that hotspots are found predominantly in montane regions with more climatic space compared to surrounding areas. Patterns of species richness and lineage diversification can largely be explained by the extent of available habitats, especially in association with montane ecosystems. We also show that patterns of species assemblages across the neotropics are largely dictated by distance and elevation. In synthesis, we propose that, in addition to migration and persistence of relictual lineages, patterns of species richness and endemism in the neotropics are driven by in situ speciation in montane regions.",2020,2021-02-25 06:59:13,2021-02-25 06:59:13,,,,4,110,,,,,,,,,,69d595a8-8515-3454-8f84-3b6db98aec80,,Script,,10.1640/0002-8444-110.4.211,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/6PLAA63Y/Suissa and Sundue - 2020 - Diversity Patterns of Neotropical Ferns Revisitin.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Methods: We test whether exposure to plant diversity protects against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by promoting immune maturation. Our sample consisted of all children born in New Zealand from 1998-2011 (n=899,126; 264 ALL cases), which we followed from birth to age five. We calculated plant-diversity metrics using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, which contains over two million geocoded plant records in New Zealand. Findings: Consistent with previous research, children who had always lived in an urban area, or who had an older mother, were at greater risk for ALL, whereas children with older siblings were at lower risk. In addition, we found that plant-diversity metrics based on the maximum number of plant genera a child was exposed to during the first two years of life were protective of ALL. Specifically, exposure to the highest tertile of plant diversity was associated with a reduction in ALL risk of 35% (95% CI: 11%-53%).",2020,2021-02-25 06:59:13,2021-02-25 06:59:13,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,5685aeab-c61b-377b-b3a0-6e6e57860dad,,Script,,10.2139/ssrn.3559635,,,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.2139/ssrn.3559635,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1556-5068,1556-5068,SSRN Electronic Journal,Elsevier BV,2020-01-01,2020,An Empirical Test of the Biodiversity Hypothesis: Exposure to Plant Diversity is Associated with a Reduced Risk of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,2021-01-17T04:57:45.663555,

We describe a new spatial modeling platform that integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when invasive insect species could potentially invade the conterminous United States. The Degree-Days, Risk, and Phenological event mapping (DDRP) platform serves as an open-source and relatively easy-to-parameterize decision support tool to help detect new invasive threats, schedule monitoring and management actions, optimize biological control, and predict potential impacts on agricultural production. DDRP uses a process-based modeling approach in which degree-days and temperature stress are calculated daily and accumulate over time to model phenology and climatic suitability, respectively. Outputs include predictions of the number of completed generations, life stages present, dates of phenological events, and climatically suitable areas based on two levels of climate stress. Species parameter values can be derived from laboratory and field studies or estimated through an additional modeling step. DDRP is written entirely in R, making it flexible and extensible, and capitalizes on multiple R packages to generate gridded and graphical outputs. We illustrate the DDRP modeling platform and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species as example threats to United States agriculture: the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana, and the small tomato borer, Neoleucinodes elegantalis.

Such environmental DNA (eDNA) methods offer an effective, noninvasive tool for species diversity measurement, although standardized protocols are not yet developed. We investigate how metrics of fish biodiversity revealed through eDNA analysis of water are influenced by sampling volume. Water samples were collected from the intertidal reef of Browse Island, a tropical, remote island in the Timor Sea. Aliquots from a single 20,700-ml sample and multiple 2,000-ml samples were filtered in various volumes (25–2,000 ml) across two membrane sizes (0.20 and 0.45 µm). A fish metabarcoding assay was used to characterize the fish diversity within aliquots. All samples, except one, yielded fish DNA sequences. Two hundred and nine operational taxonomic units (cf. species) representing 48 fish families were identified from the complete collection of DNA contained in all samples, comparable to the 200 fish species detected using conventional surveys at this location. Notable additions from eDNA methods were cryptic and nocturnal fish species. Nevertheless, large differences in taxonomic composition (<60% species overlap) between aliquots of identical volumes demonstrate that eDNA in seawater is patchy and that estimates of biodiversity are strongly influenced by the volume of water filtered.

The macromolluscan (here defned as adult molluscs >10 mm) diversity of this large marine realm has been the subject of numerous surveys over the last 50 years. However, the smaller molluscs (here defned as adult molluscs <10 mm ) have, for the most part, been ignored due to challenges in the collection and study of this assemblage. To begin to redress this imbalance a pilot project specifcally designed to target smaller molluscs was undertaken over the fnal three years (2012–2014) of the survey component of the Woodside Collection Project (Kimberley) 2009–2014. Seventy-seven stations (of 179 surveyed) were sampled yielding 1,883 identifed specimen lots representing 505 micromollusc species from ≤5 mm adult size class (following Geiger et al. 2007), 43 species from >5–10 mm adult size class, 68 species from >10 mm adult size class, which are likely to be juveniles of macromolluscs, as well as 8 species whose adult size could not be determined. This diversity spans 102 family or superfamily level taxa. Twenty-one of these familial level taxa were new to the survey area (see Bryce et al. 2018 for a full description of the Kimberley survey area) and the number of taxa recorded from a further 18 families was doubled. A considerable degree of species rarity characterised this fauna with almost 52% of all species being singletons. Less than 22% of taxa were recorded from three or more stations. A total of at least 26 new species, not yet formally described, as well as an additional 23 new records, for the survey area and/or Australia were discovered, yielding 49 new species-level records.

Their presence, abundance and potential impacts in rainforest have received less attention. Aims To investigate the distribution and diet of feral cats (Felis catus) in upland rainforest of the Wet Tropics. Methods We collated available occurrence records from the Wet Tropics, and data from upland camera-trapping surveys over an 8-year period, to assess geographic and elevational distribution of feral cats in the bioregion. We also assessed the diet of feral cats from scats collected at upland sites. Key results Feral cats are widespread through the Wet Tropics bioregion, from the lowlands to the peaks of the highest mountains (>1600 m), and in all vegetation types. Abundance appears to vary greatly across the region. Cats were readily detected during camera-trap surveys in some upland rainforest areas (particularly in the southern Atherton Tablelands and Bellenden Ker Range), but were never recorded in some areas (Thornton Peak, the upland rainforest of Windsor Tableland and Danbulla National Park) despite numerous repeated camera-trap surveys over the past 8 years at some of these sites. Scat analysis suggested that small mammals comprise ~70% of the diet of feral cats at an upland rainforest site. Multivariate analysis could not detect a difference in mammal community at sites where cats were detected or not. Conclusions Feral cats are widespread in the Wet Tropics and appear to be common in some upland areas. However, their presence and abundance are variable across the region, and the drivers of this variability are not resolved. Small mammals appear to be the primary prey in the rainforest, although the impacts of cats on the endemic and threatened fauna of the Wet Tropics is unknown. Implications Given their documented impact in some ecosystems, research is required to examine the potential impact of cats on Wet Tropics fauna, particularly the many upland endemic vertebrates. Studies are needed on (1) habitat and prey selection, (2) population dynamics, and (3) landscape source–sink dynamics of feral cats in the Wet Tropics.",2020,2020-06-15 07:08:31,2021-02-21 05:12:47,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/WR19201,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/HN4X3P8N/Rowland et al. - 2020 - Distribution and diet of feral cats (Felis catus) .pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records,10.1071/WR19201,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Many Australian Aboriginal communities also aspire towards developing natural resource-based enterprises but there is a unique combination of historical, legislative and cultural factors that make this process complex. Typically, government support for Indigenous enterprise development has focussed largely on development of ‘social enterprise’, with subsidies coming from various government community development programs. This has resulted in some increase in participation and employment, but often inadequate attention to economic aspects of enterprise development leading to low levels of business success. This paper will examine historical, legislative and institutional dimensions in business development in Aboriginal communities. It does this through a case study of business enterprise development of the Kakadu Plum products by the Indigenous people of the Thamarrurr Region of the Northern Territory, Australia, using a participant observation research method. We found that attention on important economic criteria was subsumed by a focus on social enterprise priorities during the development of this natural resource-based enterprise. This resulted in a very slow transition of the ‘social enterprise’ to the ‘financial enterprise’, due largely to fragmented business decisions and inefficient value chains.

A prime example of this is stinking passionflower (Passiflora foetida), a herbaceous vine that has invaded across the global tropics, including vast tracts of remote northern Australia. Yet despite its ubiquity in the landscape and growing concerns about its impacts on native biodiversity, surprisingly little is known about how to effectively control stinking passionflower. To address this knowledge gap, we established an 18 month long field experiment in the semi-arid Pilbara region of Western Australia to (i) understand seasonal variation in the growth phenology of stinking passionflower and identify optimal time windows for management; (ii) compare the effectiveness of different methods for controlling stinking passionflower, including both physical removal and chemical treatments; and (iii) understand the knock-on implications of these treatments for the recruitment of new cohorts of stinking passionflower seedlings and the recovery of native plant species. We found that biomass growth was tightly coupled with rainfall events, which are largely unpredictable in the study region. We also found substantial differences in the effectiveness of the different control treatments we trialled, with glyphosate foliar spray proving highly effective while plants recovered quickly following stem cutting.

Numerous old endemic, niche-conserved groups persist in the montane rainforests south of Cooktown, where concepts of serial allopatric speciation resulting from the formation of xeric interzones have largely driven our biogeographic understanding of the region. Among invertebrate taxa, studies on less vagile arachnid lineages now complement extensive research on vertebrate taxa, and phylogenetic studies on mygalomorph spiders in particular are revealing significant insights about the biogeographic history of the Australian continent since the Eocene. One mygalomorph lineage entirely endemic to Australia’s tropical and subtropical eastern rainforests is the open-holed trapdoor spider genus Namea Raven, 1984 (family Anamidae). We explore, for the first time, the phylogenetic diversity and systematics of this group of spiders, with the aims of understanding patterns of rainforest diversity in Namea, of exploring the relative roles of lineage overlap versus in situ speciation in driving predicted high levels of congeneric sympatry, and of broadly reconciling morphology with evolutionary history. Original and legacy sequences were obtained for three mtDNA and four nuDNA markers from 151 specimens, including 82 specimens of Namea. We recovered a monophyletic genus Namea sister to the genus Teyl Main, 1975, and monophyletic species clades corresponding to 30 morphospecies OTUs, including 22 OTUs nested within three main species-complex lineages. Remarkable levels of sympatry for a single genus of mygalomorph spiders were revealed in rainforest habitats, with upland subtropical rainforests in south-eastern Queensland often home to multiple (up to six) congeners of usually disparate phylogenetic affinity living in direct sympatry or close parapatry, likely the result of simultaneous allopatric speciation in already co-occurring lineages, and more recent dispersal in a minority of taxa. In situ speciation, in contrast, appears to have played a relatively minor role in generating sympatric diversity within rainforest ‘islands’. At the population level, changes in the shape and spination of the male first leg relative to evolutionary history reveal subtle but consistent interspecific morphological shifts in the context of otherwise intraspecific variation, and understanding this morphological variance provides a useful framework for future taxonomic monography. Based on the phylogenetic results, we further provide a detailed taxonomic synopsis of the genus Namea, formally diagnosing three main species-complexes (the brisbanensis-complex, the dahmsi-complex and the jimna-complex), re-illustrating males of all 15 described species, and providing images of live spiders and burrows where available. In doing so, we reveal a huge undescribed diversity of Namea species from tropical and subtropical rainforest habitats, and an old endemic fauna that is beginning to shed light on more complex patterns of rainforest biogeography.",2020,2020-10-12 01:58:13,2021-02-21 05:05:52,,679-726,,7,34,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/IS20004,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/HPJA9T6C/Rix et al. - 2020 - First phylogenetic assessment and taxonomic synops.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1071/IS20004,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Results and Conclusions: Within-species, we found consistent increases in LMA, LDMC and WD, and HV with increasing aridity, resulting in consistent trait coordination across tissues.

Unlike trait means, patterns of trait variance with aridity were mixed across populations and species and showed limited support for constrained trait variation in dryer populations or more xeric species.

Post-fire regeneration mechanisms of the obligate-seeder subspecies on the Australian mainland are well-known, but less is known about the resprouter Tasmanian subspecies. In January 2016, large tracts of Eucalyptus delegatensis forests in central Tasmania, logged at different intensities, were burnt by low- and high-severity fire. We used statistical modelling to understand how tree survival, vegetative regeneration and seedling recruitment differed according to understorey type, fire severity, logging intensity and tree size (DBH). Fire severity, defined as unburnt, low-severity (fire scarring on the stem and/or lower canopy burnt) and high-severity (full canopy burnt), affected tree survival: 84% of trees were alive in unburnt transects, compared with 43% in low-severity transects and 36% in high-severity transects. Epicormic resprouting was the dominant mode of vegetative recovery, with < 1% of total trees recovering solely by basal resprouting. Fire severity significantly affected epicormic resprouting, with 70% of live stems resprouting post-fire in low-severity transects and 99% in high-severity transects, compared with 4% in unburnt transects. Tree survival was strongly influenced by tree size: in high-severity transects, 24% of trees with DBH < 20 cm were alive, compared with 88% of trees with DBH ≥ 20 cm. These differences in survival were primarily because large trees were more likely to resprout epicormically, with epicormic shoots present on 24% of live trees with DBH < 20 cm, compared with 79% of live trees with DBH ≥ 80 cm. The strong effect of tree size renders clear-felled forests especially vulnerable to fire during the several decades when all the regenerating trees are small (DBH < 20 cm). Seedling recruitment was uncommon, independent of understorey type and logging intensity, but with higher occurrence on high-severity (54%) than low-severity (19%) or unburnt (15%) transects. When present, seedling densities were typically low: median = 400 and maximum = 4·104 seedlings ha−1. This study highlights that mature forests of Eucalyptus delegatensis in Tasmania are more resilient (able to return to pre-disturbance conditions) to single high-severity fires than their mainland counterparts, because they can recover more quickly through epicormic resprouting. However, clear-felling reduces this resilience for several decades because it decreases median tree size and, hence, leads to higher post-fire mortality. It is difficult to predict how the Tasmanian subspecies will respond to an increased frequency of high-severity fires associated with a projected warmer and drier climate.",2020,2020-06-26 04:21:36,2021-02-21 04:57:50,,118292,,,473,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118292,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/UMTY36VS/Rodriguez-Cubillo et al. - 2020 - Variation in Eucalyptus delegatensis post-fire rec.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118292,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0378-1127,0378-1127,Forest Ecology and Management,Elsevier BV,2020-10-01,2020,Variation in Eucalyptus delegatensis post-fire recovery strategies: The Tasmanian subspecies is a resprouter whereas the mainland Australian subspecies is an obligate seeder,2021-01-15T19:31:57.309237,

We found that A. hispidus appears to be much more widespread than previously known, with high rates of occurrence at predicted but previously unsurveyed sites, and approximately 15% of the study area projected to be suitable habitat for the species. We estimated that the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of the species exceeded vulnerable species listing criteria thresholds within IUCN guidelines. This study demonstrates how species distribution modelling can add to existing resources to provide cost-effective data to inform and streamline conservation planning.",2020,2020-01-24 00:17:44,2021-02-21 04:53:17,,125792,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125792,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/T4M9MMFQ/White et al. - 2020 - Rare or overlooked The distribution of Hairy Join.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Survey Planning,10.1016/j.jnc.2020.125792,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1617-1381,1617-1381,Journal for Nature Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-04-01,2020,"Rare or overlooked?

We assessed the plasticity of morphological and physiological traits of tree species planted along an urban climatic gradient in the Greater Sydney region during a severe, multi-year drought in eastern Australia. We selected four sites along a ∼55 km east-west transect, ranging from the cool/wet coast to the warm/dry inland. We assessed five tree species (four natives, one exotic) with different predicted climatic vulnerability based on climate-origins, estimating functional traits indicative of drought tolerance: carbon isotope composition (δ13C), Huber value (HV), specific leaf area (SLA), wood density (WD), and leaf turgor loss point (πtlp). Broadly, trees planted in warm/dry sites had more negative πtlp, higher WD, δ13C and HV, and lower SLA than cool/wet sites, indicating phenotypic plasticity to drought. The leaf-level traits πtlp, δ13C and SLA were more strongly correlated with temperature and precipitation, compared to HV and WD. Species differed in the extent of their trait shifts along the transect, with greater plasticity evident in the exotic Celtis australis and the more temperate cool-climate Tristaniopsis laurina, compared to the more tropical, warm-climate Cupaniopsis anacardioides, which showed limited plasticity and lower drought tolerance.

Here we measure the temperature response in isoprene emissions from saplings of four different Eucalyptus species grown under current and future average summertime temperature conditions. The future conditions represent a 2050 climate under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, with average daytime temperatures of 294.5 K. Ramping the temperature from 293 to 328 K resulted in these eucalypts emitting isoprene at temperatures 4–9 K higher than the default maximum emission temperature in the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). New basal emission rate measurements were obtained at the standard conditions of 303 K leaf temperature and 1000 µmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetically active radiation and converted into landscape emission factors. We applied the eucalypt temperature responses and emission factors to Australian trees within MEGAN and ran the CSIRO Chemical Transport Model for three summertime campaigns in Australia. Compared to the default model, the new temperature responses resulted in less isoprene emission in the morning and more during hot afternoons, improving the statistical fit of modelled to observed ambient isoprene. Compared to current conditions, an additional 2 ppb of isoprene is predicted in 2050, causing hourly increases up to 21 ppb of ozone and 24-hourly increases of 0.4 µg m−3 of aerosol in Sydney. A 550 ppm CO2 atmosphere in 2050 mitigates these peak Sydney ozone mixing ratios by 4 ppb.

Here we draw attention to an emerging subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, explainable AI (xAI), as a toolbox for better interpreting SDMs. xAI aims at deciphering the behavior of complex statistical or machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, random forests, boosted regression trees), and can produce more transparent and understandable SDM predictions. We describe the rationale behind xAI and provide a list of tools that can be used to help ecological modelers better understand complex model behavior at different scales. As an example, we perform a reproducible SDM analysis in R on the African elephant and showcase some xAI tools such as local interpretable model‐agnostic explanation (LIME) to help interpret local‐scale behavior of the model.

Here, we report a newly discovered fossil lantern fruit with a suite of features characteristic of Physalideae within Solanaceae. The fossil comes from the early Eocene Laguna del Hunco site (ca. 52 Ma) in Chubut, Argentina, which previously yielded the only other physaloid fruit fossil, Physalis infinemundi. Methods The fruit morphology and calyx venation pattern of the new fossil were compared with P. infinemundi and extant species of Solanaceae. Results Physalis hunickenii sp. nov. is clearly distinct from P. infinemundi in its fruiting calyx with wider primary veins, longer and thinner lobes, and especially in its venation pattern with high density, transverse tertiary veins; these features support its placement in a new species. In comparison with extant physaloid genera, the calyx venation pattern and other diagnostic traits reinforce placement of the new fossil, like P. infinemundi, within the tribe Physalideae of Solanaceae. Conclusions Both species of fossil nightshades from Laguna del Hunco represent crown‐group Solanaceae but are older than all prior age estimates of the family. Although at least 20 transoceanic dispersals have been proposed as the driver of range expansion of Solanaceae, the Patagonian fossils push back the diversification of the family to Gondwanan times.

More recently (2018), Halophila decipiens was observed for the first time in the eastern Mediterranean, and was described as the second non-native seagrass species in the Mediterranean Sea. We implemented a species distribution model (SDM) approach to (1) hindcast the habitat suitability of H. stipulacea over the last 100 years in the Mediterranean basin, and (2) to model the increase in the potential habitat suitability of H. stipulacea and H. decipiens during the current century under two very different climate scenarios, RCP 2.6 (lowest carbon emission scenario) and RCP 8.5 (highest carbon emission scenario). In addition, a principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means cluster based on temperature and salinity drivers were applied to visualize the distance and relatedness between the native and invasive H. stipulacea and H. decipiens populations. Results from this PCA suggest that the H. stipulacea populations of the Mediterranean and Red Sea are likely to be similar. In contrast, H. decipiens from the Mediterranean is more related to the Atlantic populations rather than to the Red Sea populations. The hindcast model suggests that the expansion of H. stipulacea was related to the increases in seawater temperatures in the Mediterranean over the last 100 years. The SDMs predict that more suitable habitat will become available for both tropical species during this century. The habitat suitability for H. stipulacea will keep expanding westward and northward as the Mediterranean continues to become saltier and warmer. In comparison, the SDMs built for H. decipiens forecast a restricted habitat suitability in the south-eastern Mediterranean Sea at the present environmental conditions and predicts a progressive expansion with a potential increase in habitat suitability along 85% of the Mediterranean coastline. The predicted rapid expansion of non-native seagrass species could alter the Mediterranean’s seagrass community and may entail massive impacts on associated ecosystem functions and services, impacts that have severe socio-economic consequences.",2020,2021-02-10 04:58:47,2021-02-10 04:58:47,,555376,,,11,,,,,,,,,,7e16563a-64fe-301a-952a-cde64114e646,,Script,,10.3389/fpls.2020.555376,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/HBVJGDGA/Beca-Carretero et al. - 2020 - Projected Rapid Habitat Expansion of Tropical Seag.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.3389/fpls.2020.555376,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1664-462X,1664-462X,Frontiers in Plant Science,Frontiers Media SA,2020-11-16,2020,Projected Rapid Habitat Expansion of Tropical Seagrass Species in the Mediterranean Sea as Climate Change Progresses,2021-02-06T09:28:00.830548,

Dispersal also plays an important role in the capacity of species to track suitable climate, which is particularly relevant for amphibians with limited dispersal ability. In this study, we included different lineages and dispersal distances into species distribution models to make them more biologically relevant in face of climate change scenarios. Location Europe. Taxa Bombina variegata and its lineages. Methods Using MaxEnt, we fitted correlative niche models for B. variegata lineages and also for the species level (B. variegata sensu lato) that we projected under Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and future climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP8.5). A comparison of projections was conducted considering both unlimited and limited dispersal abilities. Results We found that the B. variegata lineages differed in their bioclimatic niches. In general, models run without discriminating the lineages showed reduced suitable areas compared to models run at each lineage, especially those for B. variegata pachypus and B. variegata scabra (southern lineages). Suitable areas identified for the LGM match with the climatic refugia identified in phylogeographic studies. Projections for the mid‐Holocene showed the increase of suitable areas for the lineages B. variegata variegata “Carpathians” and “Western” while they decreased for the southern lineages. In the future (2040–2080), only models under limited dispersal predict the extinction of the Carpathian lineage and a reduction in suitable areas for the other lineages, regardless of periods and scenarios. Main conclusions We demonstrated important shifts in habitat suitability in Europe suggesting range‐shifts about hundreds of kilometres in response to past climate changes. However, rapid and unprecedented changes in suitability are expected in the future due to the accelerated climate warming during the 21st. According to their limited dispersal abilities, the persistence of all B. variegata lineages over time appears uncertain.

These models relate species occurrences with the environmental conditions found at these sites. Climatic variables are the most commonly used environmental data and are usually included in SDMs as averages of a reference period (30–50 years). In this study, we analyse the impact of including inter‐annual climatic variability on the estimation of species niches and predicted distributions when assessing plant demographic response to extreme climatic episodes. Location Mediterranean basin, SE Iberian Peninsula. Methods We first characterized species niches with inter‐annual and average climate in the same environmental space. We then compare the respective capacities of climatic suitability obtained from averaged climate‐based and from inter‐annual variability‐based niches to explain population demographic responses to extreme drought. Furthermore, we assessed the relative increase in niche size when including climatic variability for a set of Mediterranean species exhibiting a wide range of distribution areas. Results We found that climatic suitability obtained from inter‐annual variability‐based niches showed higher explanatory capacity than average climate‐based suitability, especially for populations living in climatically marginal conditions, although both niches quantifications significantly explained species demographic responses. In addition, species with restricted distribution ranges increased relatively more their niche space when considering climatic variability, probably because in widely distributed species spatial variability compensates for temporal variability. Main conclusions The common use of climatic averages when characterizing species niches could lead to underestimations of species distribution and misunderstanding of demographic behaviour, with implications for conservation plans derived from SDMs, for example, overestimations of species extinction risk under climate change, or underestimations of alien species invasion’ risk.

Yet, Uruguay – a country where multiple major ecosystems converge – ranks amongst the countries with the lowest levels of available digital biodiversity data in the continent. Such prevalent data scarcity has significantly undermined our ability to progress towards evidence-based conservation actions – a critical limitation for a country with a strong focus on agricultural industries and only 1.3% of the land surface guarded by protected areas. Under today’s rapid biodiversity loss and environmental changes, the need for open-access biodiversity data is more pressing than ever before. To address this national issue, Biodiversidata – Uruguay’s first Consortium of Biodiversity Data – has recently emerged with the aim of assembling a constantly growing database for the biodiversity of this country. While the first phase of the project targeted vertebrate biodiversity, the second phase presented in this paper spans the biodiversity of plants.             As part of the second phase of the Biodiversidata initiative, we present the first comprehensive open-access species-level database of the vascular plant diversity recorded in Uruguay to date (i.e. all species for which data are currently available and species presence has been confirmed). It contains 12,470 occurrence records from across 1,648 species and 160 families, which roughly represents 60% of the total recorded flora of Uruguay. The primary biodiversity data include extant native and introduced species from the lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms groups.

It also enables us to maximize the success of searches for effective biological control agents. We determined the number of successful colonization events that have occurred throughout the world for two Cakile species and compared the climates from which they originated, in which they established and then spread. Location Worldwide. Taxon Sea‐Rockets (Cakile spp.), Brassicaceae. Methods We used a high‐throughput sequencing and a genome skimming approach combined with Bayesian Inference phylogenetics to examine variation in entire chloroplast genomes and regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA within native and introduced areas. Databases were used to compare climates between native ranges and introduced regions for multiple clades within each species. Results At least seven clades have invaded different regions of the world. In most cases we were able to identify their source regions and climates. The environmental bottlenecks differed in intensity: while some clades colonized into climates that were similar to climates in their native range, other clades had a very broad innate environmental tolerance such that new invasions succeeded beyond the climate range of native populations. We found clear evidence of hybridization—specifically, chloroplast capture—between two species in Australia. Conclusions Results here show that these species are sometimes capable of colonizing in climates that are beyond the climate range of native populations. Whether successful colonization beyond native climate niches requires de novo adaptation, or whether it represents an innate broad fundamental niche requires further investigation.

Yet, such data are strongly affected by sampling biases, mostly related to site accessibility. The understanding of these biases is therefore crucial in systematics, biogeography and conservation. Here we present a novel approach for quantifying sampling effort and its impact on biodiversity knowledge, focusing on Africa. In contrast to previous studies assessing sampling completeness (percentage of species recorded in relation to predicted), we investigate whether the lack of knowledge of a site attracts scientists to visit these areas and collect samples of species. We then estimate the time required to sample 90% of the continent under a Weibull distributed biodiversity sampling rate and the number of sampling events required to record ≥50% of the species. Using linear and spatial regression models, we show that previous sampling has been strongly influencing the resampling of areas, attracting repeated visits. This bias has existed for over two centuries, has increased in recent decades, and is most pronounced among mammals. It may take between 172 and 274 years, depending on the group, to achieve at least one sampling event per grid cell in the entire continent. Just one visit will however not be enough: in order to record ≥50% of the current diversity, it will require at least 12 sampling events for amphibians, 13 for mammals and 27 for birds. Our results demonstrate the importance of sampling areas that lack primary biodiversity data and the urgency with which this needs to be done.

Reversed expansion from temperate to pantropic climate through a polyploidization‐driven shift in heat‐tolerance remains largely unknown. Here, we found autopolyploidy in relation to the global expansion of Solidago canadensis from its temperate‐climate native range in North American to hot‐summer climate in an introduced range. Our cytogeographical study of 2062 accessions from 471 locations worldwide demonstrates that ploidy levels correlates negatively with latitude and positively with average temperature. An isotherm‐dependent shift of the climate niches at the threshold of 20‐24ºC between geo‐cytotypes can be attributed mainly to autopolyploidy‐driven differentiation of heat tolerance; only polyploids and not diploids are able to complete sexual reproduction, germinate and grow in the hot‐summer climate of low latitudes. Ploidy‐dependent fertility appears to play a key role in the hot‐summer introduced range in the northern hemisphere through both pre‐adaptation and rapid post‐introduction adaptive evolution of delayed flowering and improved heat‐tolerance during embryo development.

However, these ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, including overexploitation, infrastructure developments, habitat alteration, and alien species introductions. The magnitude of these threats varies in different water bodies, requiring site-based conservation actions. In this paper, we aimed at developing a priority index (CPIw) that can be used to inform conservation managers in prioritizing the selection of a waterbody for site-based fish conservation purposes. We used data on distribution, diversity, and conservation status of fishes of Uganda, which were retrieved from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and International Union Conservation for Nature (IUCN) databases. In the index, we incorporated the species richness, surface area of a waterbody, species rarity, and species IUCN status. A total of 288 fish species were recorded in 81 waterbodies (7 large lakes, 37 small lakes, and 37 rivers). Of these species, 110 were only found in large lakes, followed by rivers (19) and small lakes (6). Despite the higher species richness in large lakes relative to small lakes, the latter recorded significantly higher CPIw compared with the former (t = −2.8, df = 30, p-value = 0.008, d=0.7). This observation is consistent with the expectation, given the low ecological substitutability for the species and higher levels of exposure to human-induced threats in small water bodies compared with large systems. Therefore, we suggest that in situations where resources are limiting, small water bodies need to be given much attention, although we do not suggest ignoring water bodies with low CPIw values.",2020,2021-02-10 04:58:47,2021-02-10 04:58:47,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,0933822a-1d6f-3152-b6dd-87f0f2d526ee,,Script,,10.1101/2020.11.12.380618,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/XXLL9Y7H/Basooma et al. - 2020 - Using the novel priority index in prioritizing the.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1101/2020.11.12.380618,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,posted-content,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,2020-11-14,2020,Using the novel priority index in prioritizing the selection of inland water bodies for site-based fish species conservation,2021-02-12T18:43:34.844526,

We document this recent invasion by compiling occurrence records, develop a species distribution model identifying important determinants of invasion, and project potential range expansion. Our results indicate T. coccinea currently is distributed along the GoM coast from the Florida Keys to southern Texas, with documented localities clustered ≈ 100 km off the Louisiana coast and ≈ 200 km off the Texas coast, and sparsely distributed elsewhere. Our species distribution model identified five environmental factors that together contribute > 99% to the overall model.

Location Australia, Papua New Guinea, Florida. Taxon Earleaf acacia. Methods We sampled A. auriculiformis from across its entire native distribution (northern Australia, Papua New Guinea) and its invasive range in Florida, and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to assess population structuring. Results Principal component analysis, based on 9591 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms, indicated significant differentiation among samples from Papua New Guinea, the Northern Territory (Australia) and north Queensland (Australia). Florida samples also formed a distinct cluster, with these samples most closely related to samples from the Northern Territory. These results indicate that the Florida A. auriculiformis lineage most likely originates from the Northern Territory, with no evidence that plants were introduced from different parts of the native range. We found evidence of allelic shifts in the Florida population, suggesting rapid adaptation to environmental conditions may contribute the success of the invasive lineage. Main conclusions Two well‐known biogeographic barriers—the Carpentaria Gap and Torres Strait—have caused genome‐wide divergence among A. auriculiformis plants from north Queensland, Northern Territory and Papua New Guinea. The taxonomic status of these allopatric populations should be further assessed.

Hybridisation is among the least understood of these processes, despite its multifaceted role in speciation processes being widely accepted. Species of the large arctic-alpine genus Saxifraga are notorious for their ability to hybridise; however, the overall role of hybridisation and polyploidisation for the diversification of this genus remains unknown. Here, we provide a comprehensive genus-wide review of hybridisation accounts and ploidy levels. We find that the sections of Saxifraga vary greatly in their propensity to hybridise. The majority of natural hybridisation accounts are from recent localised events (n = 71). Hybridisation hotspots were located in the Pyrenees and the European Alps, thus contrasting with the overall distribution of species richness in the genus. Hybrids or hybrid populations are often short-lived in Saxifraga due to a multitude of reproductive barriers, most commonly low F1 hybrid fertility. However, these barriers are not always fully effective, allowing for backcrossing and the formation of hybrid swarms. In addition, we find that the incidence of polyploidy varies widely across different sections of Saxifraga, with species-rich sections Porphyrion and Saxifraga showing divergent polyploidy proportions. Overall, we show that hybridisation and polyploidisation played differential roles in the diversification of this large genus. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of species are yet to be scrutinised, particularly among the Asian Saxifraga species, illustrating the need for systematic further study to fully unravel the role of hybridisation during the evolution of Saxifraga.",2020,2021-02-10 04:58:47,2021-02-10 04:58:47,,440,,11,12,,,,,,,en,,,aa9dfcd1-ed78-30f4-8a8b-f70df1df0d37,,Script,,10.3390/d12110440,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/9SSNFVLR/Ebersbach et al. - 2020 - The Role of Hybridisation in the Making of the Spe.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.3390/d12110440,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,1424-2818,1424-2818,Diversity,MDPI AG,2020-11-23,2020,The Role of Hybridisation in the Making of the Species-Rich Arctic-Alpine Genus Saxifraga (Saxifragaceae),2021-02-06T10:44:04.723402,

Human‐induced gene movement through afforestation and the selective transportation of genotypes might enhance the potential for intraspecific hybridization, which could lead to outbreeding depression. However, the evolutionary legacy of afforestation on the spatial genetic structure of forest tree species has barely been investigated. To do this properly, the effects of anthropogenic and natural processes must be examined simultaneously. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating phylogeography, population genetics, species distribution modeling, and niche divergence would permit evaluation of potential anthropogenic impacts, such as mass planting near‐native material. Here, these approaches were applied to Pinus armandii, a Chinese endemic coniferous tree species, that has been mass planted across its native range. Population genetic analyses showed that natural populations of P. armandii comprised three lineages that diverged around the late Miocene, during a period of massive uplifts of the Hengduan Mountains, and intensification of Asian Summer Monsoon. Only limited gene flow was detected between lineages, indicating that each largely maintained is genetic integrity. Moreover, most or all planted populations were found to have been sourced within the same region, minimizing disruption of large‐scale spatial genetic structure within P. armandii. This might be because each of the three lineages had a distinct climatic niche, according to ecological niche modeling and niche divergence tests. The current study provides empirical genetic and ecological evidence for the site‐species matching principle in forestry and will be useful to manage restoration efforts by identifying suitable areas and climates for introducing and planting new forests.

Neocussonia shows a higher average length of vessel elements (1319 µm) and number of bars on perforation plates (up to 66) than any other Araliaceae examined to date. Neocussonia is distinct from Astropanax by its smaller diameter and higher frequency of vessels, rare occurrence of simple perforation plates, more numerous bars on scalariform perforation plates and smaller intervessel pits. The interspecific variation in percentage of simple perforation plates, bar number on scalariform perforation plates, vessel frequency and uniseriate ray number is affected by seasonality in temperature and precipitation.

The current practice of delimiting biomes relies on expert knowledge. Recent studies have questioned the value of such biome maps for comparative ecology and global‐change research, partly due to their subjective origin. Here we propose a flexible method for developing biome maps objectively. The method uses range modelling of several thousands of plant species to reveal spatial attractors for different growth‐form assemblages that define biomes. The workflow is illustrated using distribution data from 23 500 African plant species. In an example application, we create a biome map for Africa and use the fitted species models to project biome shifts. In a second example, we map gradients of growth‐form suitability that can be used to identify sites for comparative ecology.

This study aims to investigate how fine-scale land-cover variables influence species richness patterns of locally threatened and alien species. The study was performed in Trondheim, Norway, covering a steep urbanisation gradient. Spatially correlated Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Models predicting the number of all-, threatened-and alien species by taxon, habitat, habitat heterogeneity and mean aspect within 500 m×500 m grid cells were constructed. The habitat categories were based on detailed land-cover maps. The highest number of threatened species was found in habitats relatively less affected by humans, whereas the number of alien species were only dependent on taxonomic group and spatial correlation.

Therefore, they might underestimate suitable ranges, but including physiological information can improve accuracy of predictions and help identify mechanisms of e.g. range limitation. However, approaches using both, results from correlative as well as physiological investigations are rare, especially in research on seaweeds. Here, we provide results from both approaches to predict the suitable habitat range of Capreolia implexa (Rhodophyta) in its native range (Australia and New Zealand) and invaded range (Chile) under present and future climate scenarios (year 2100, rcp 2.6 and rcp 8.5). We used the Maxent modelling technique and physiological knowledge from a temperature tolerance experiment (2–20 °C) for thermal niche estimation. Results from both approaches suggest larger suitable habitat ranges under present day conditions for both regions than currently occupied. Abiotic range limitation in the native range led to underestimation of the suitable temperature range by Maxent (here lower temperature limit = 8.3 °C). Predictions based on the laboratory temperature tolerance experiment suggest additional suitable habitat in colder regions (here lower temperature limit = 6.6 ± 0.4 °C). Under future climate conditions, both native and invaded ranges should shift southward, which will lead to an overall loss of suitable habitat in the native range. Like that, rcp 8.5 conditions should reduce the native range to 50% of the present-day extent. We demonstrate the limitation of correlative SDM modelling for species that live on continental margins and that physiological experiments can help to identify species’ niches beyond correlative analyses, providing valuable information for range projections.

Despite increasing research effort in recent years many fundamental questions remain to be answered before we can effectively manage the issue. One question is whether the greater number of NIMS thus far documented in temperate waters is real or an artefact of fewer surveys being undertaken in tropical environments. Another one is whether poor taxonomic knowledge of the biodiverse tropics hides NIMS that actually occur there. Extensive taxonomic work in three Pacific localities (Guam, northern Western Australia and Singapore) has been collated in previous papers showing that there are relatively few NIMS in these biodiverse environments. The present paper replicates investigations for a low latitude environment in southern Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. The focus area includes the extensive Florida Keys coral reef environment, the southern margin of the Everglades on Florida Bay and the major PortMiami. Only 48 NIMS were identified in a literature-based compilation of 4,615 species; 15 species were represented by isolated records and have not established populations, leaving only 33 NIMS that are established or whose status is unknown. Records for Mollusca, the group with the most species (1,153) in the compilation, were individually researched and taxonomically verified. It is argued that the relative paucity of NIMS is not a straightforward temperature-driven tropical/temperate issue, but instead there are biological factor(s) restricting the ability of NIMS to colonise biodiverse environments compared to less diverse areas.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-21 10:06:12,,372-398,,3,11,,,,,,,,,,54eca206-f20c-36e9-a732-480a31c4c3f2,,Script,,10.3391/mbi.2020.11.3.02,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/GDVDPMFB/Wells and Bieler - 2020 - A low number of introduced marine species at low l.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.3391/mbi.2020.11.3.02,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,1989-8649,1989-8649,Management of Biological Invasions,Regional Euro-Asian Biological Invasions Centre Oy (REABIC),2020-01-01,2020,A low number of introduced marine species at low latitudes: a case study from southern Florida with a special focus on Mollusca,2021-01-19T04:20:21.130991,

While most studies have focused on how to detect the SIE, the underlying ecological factors determining this pattern remain largely unexplored. Here, we evaluate one of the few mechanisms proposed to explain the SIE, the subsidized island biogeography hypothesis, which posits that marine productivity around small islands may alter their expected species richness. Location Seven hundred and ninety islands worldwide, including 420 islands < 1 km2. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Angiosperms. Methods We applied iterative partial regression to determine the effects of island area and marine productivity on plant species richness for islands of varying sizes. We also employed geographically weighted regression to account for non‐stationarity in the marine productivity effects. Lastly, we used estimates of ammonia emissions based on nutrient excretion by seabird colonies from a subset of 66 islands to evaluate the effects of marine resources deposition on angiosperm species richness. Results We found no effect of marine productivity on insular species richness, at both regional and global scales. In all models, area emerged as the only predictor of plant species richness. A weak contribution of marine productivity was only detectable in models with a low number of islands, but this effect was independent of island size. Although nutrient deposition significantly contributes to explaining plant diversity, this effect was also independent of island size. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that marine productivity has no general effect on plant species richness of small islands worldwide. Although marine‐derived resources may still contribute to species richness variation, this effect does not seem to be restricted to small islands.

The species appears to be common but patchy in the national park, for the most part occurring westward from the Mount Buffalo Road. It is now known from nine regions on the plateau and upper slopes ranging in elevation from 1060 to 1560 m. The males patrol close to the ground in heathlands and along the edges of carriageways through snow gum and tall open forests where patches of Veronica derwentiana (Plantaginaceae) exist. Females usually fly close to the larval hosts or in areas where flowers are abundant and are seen less often. The species appears to have just one brood per year at these elevations. The adults can be found from at least the second week of November through to the first week of January.

New mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data affirm multiple prior studies in aligning P. pectoralis fuliginosa with other subspecies of P. pectoralis, not P. occidentalis. Conversely, principal coordinates and phylogenetic analyses of new data from >17,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms show P. occidentalis and P. pectoralis fuliginosa barely differentiated from each other, neither being close to any P. pectoralis subspecies. In earlier work, weak, ambiguous signal in nuclear DNA sequences possibly suggested close relationship between P. occidentalis and P. pectoralis fuliginosa but was ‘swamped’ by the phylogenetic signal of the mtDNA. Accordingly, we recognise one species, P. fuliginosa Vigors and Horsfield, 1827, having two subspecies P. fuliginosa occidentalis and P. fuliginosa fuliginosa. Western Whistler remains an appropriate English name for the species P. fuliginosa. MtDNA of Golden Whistler P. pectoralis is hypothesised to have introgressed westwards into the range of P. fuliginosa fuliginosa but not further west into P. fuliginosa occidentalis and we address this.

For example, what are the extents of seasonal range overlap, intergradation and niche differentiation of Golden and Western Whistlers in south-eastern Australia and of the two subspecies of Western Whistler?",2020,2021-01-05 00:13:33,2021-01-05 00:14:21,,1-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1080/01584197.2020.1854047,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/83IEKV92/Joseph et al. - 2020 - How far east can a Western Whistler go Genomic da.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1080/01584197.2020.1854047,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0158-4197,1448-5540",0158-4197,Emu - Austral Ornithology,Informa UK Limited,2020-12-20,2020,"How far east can a Western Whistler go?

Infection especially affects immunocompromised animals and humans. In wildlife, cryptococcosis appears to be more prevalent in captive populations. The objective of this study was to assess whether apparently healthy quokkas (Setonix brachyurus) harbor Cryptococcus spp. Using cultural and molecular methods, we studied yeasts isolated from nasal swabs collected from 130 free-ranging quokkas on Rottnest Island (RI, n = 97) and the mainland (n = 33) of Western Australia. Unspeciated Cryptococcus spp. (from four quokkas), C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) (two quokkas) and C. magnus (one quokka) were isolated from the nasal lining of apparently healthy quokkas from RI. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii was isolated from animals captured in a human-populated area on RI. There was no significant effect of the presence of Cryptococcus on the results of haematology, blood chemistry, peripheral blood cell morphology or clinical examination.

This chronic threat of over-predation, coupled with the possible extinction of the genetically distinct southern population (approx. 40 individuals in the wild), makes this species a candidate for a conservation translocation. Here, we use species distribution models to identify translocation sites for the brush-tailed rock-wallaby.

To investigate mechanisms underlying the plasticity of two cosmopolitan (Phragmites, Typha) and two endemic (Cycnogeton procerum, Cyperus gymnocaulos) macrophytes in response to disturbance (fluctuating hydrological regimes) across a nutrient gradient, we analysed historical data from pond experiments with single-species pots. Our analyses showed fluctuating water levels in nutrient-enriched conditions reduced total biomass in all species, with 65% and 46% reduction in Phragmites and Typha respectively. Contrary to expectations, only Cycnogeton allocated a higher proportion of biomass to protect (root) and store (rhizome) resources in fluctuating water levels and nutrient-enriched conditions (45% versus 23% in stable regime), and was the most plastic by allocating 75% more biomass to belowground in the least favourable conditions.

Data derived from European NSCs underpin countless discoveries and innovations, including tens of thousands of scholarly publications and official reports annually (supporting legislative and regulatory processes on sustainability, environmental change, land use, societal infrastructure, health, food, security, etc.); base-line biodiversity data; inventions and products essential to bio-economy; databases, maps and descriptions of scientific observations; educational material for students; and instructive and informative resources for the public. To expand the user community, DiSSCo will strengthen capacity building across Europe for maximum engagement of stakeholders in the biodiversity-related field and beyond, including industry and the private sector, but also policy-driving entities. Hence, it is opportune to reach out to relevant stakeholders in the European environmental policy domain represented by the European Environment Agency (EEA). The EEA aims to support sustainable development by helping to achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment, through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public.

C. Cheng, which is a remarkable rare relict plant, has gradually been reduced to its current narrow range due to climate change. Understanding the comprehensive distribution of M. glyptostroboides under climate change on a large spatio-temporal scale is of great signiﬁcance for determining its forest adaptation. In this study, based on 394 occurrence data and 10 bioclimatic variables, the global potential distribution of M. glyptostroboides under eight diﬀerent climate scenarios (i.e., the past three, the current one, and the next four) from the Quaternary glacial to the future was simulated by a random forest model built with the biomod2 package. The key bioclimatic variables aﬀecting the distribution of M. glyptostroboides are BIO2 (mean diurnal range), BIO1 (annual mean temperature), BIO9 (mean temperature of driest quarter), BIO6 (min temperature of coldest month), and BIO18 (precipitation of warmest quarter). The result indicates that the temperature aﬀects the potential distribution of M. glyptostroboides more than the precipitation. A visualization of the results revealed that the current relatively suitable habitats of M. glyptostroboides are mainly distributed in East Asia and Western Europe, with a total area of approximately 6.857 × 106 km2. With the intensiﬁcation of global warming in the future, the potential distribution and the suitability of M. glyptostroboides have a relatively non-pessimistic trend. Whether under the mild (RCP4.5) and higher (RCP8.5) emission scenarios, the total area of suitable habitats will be wider than it is now by the 2070s, and the habitat suitability will increase to varying degrees within a wide spatial range. After speculating on the potential distribution of M. glyptostroboides in the past, the glacial refugia of M. glyptostroboides were inferred, and projections regarding the future conditions of these places are expected to be optimistic. In order to better protect the species, the locations of its priority protected areas and key protected areas, mainly in Western Europe and East Asia, were further identiﬁed. Our results will provide theoretical reference for the long-term management of M. glyptostroboides, and can be used as background information for the restoration of other endangered species in the future.",2020,2020-01-09 03:07:13,2020-07-13 06:56:00,,62,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,,,GS 2020,,10.3390/f11010062,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/WWNLWXT5/Zhang et al. - 2020 - Non-Pessimistic Predictions of the Distributions a.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records,10.3390/f11010062,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,1999-4907,1999-4907,Forests,MDPI AG,2020-01-04,2020,Non-Pessimistic Predictions of the Distributions and Suitability of Metasequoia glyptostroboides under Climate Change Using a Random Forest Model,2021-11-23T17:27:23.139190,

The species relies on dead softwood from a small selection of plant species for making its nests. Habitat fragmentation, combined with deleterious fire events, is thought to have negatively impacted on nesting substrate availability and recolonisation chances. Here, we use MaxEnt algorithm to model both the current distribution and the effect of climate change scenarios on the distribution of both X. aerata and four plant species that provide most of its nesting substrate: Banksia integrifolia, B. marginata, Xanthorrhoea arborea and Xanthorrhoea semiplana subsp. tateana. The annual mean temperature is the strongest climatic predictor of the distribution of X. aerata and its host plants. The modelled distribution of the bee under current climatic conditions indicates that climatic factors are unlikely to cause local extinctions. In all future scenarios, suitable areas for X. aerata and each of its nesting hosts are expected to contract towards the southeast of mainland Australia. The suitability of Kangaroo Island for the bee and its current local current host species is maintained in all scenarios, while Tasmania will become increasingly suitable for all species. The Grampians National Park in western Victoria, where the bee species were last seen outside of its current range (in the 1930s), is predicted to remain suitable for X. aerata and several host plants under all scenarios.

We first clarified phylogenetic relationships among them and then detected a low level of gene flow in parapatry between a non-sister pair (Brown, Inland). Further work could partition relative roles of past and current hybridization. We identify likely cases of ecologically driven divergent selection and one of convergent evolution. Divergent selection was likely key to divergence of Inland Thornbills from the Brown–Mountain sister pair. In contrast, convergence in plumage between the non-sister Brown and Inland Thornbills has been driven by their mesic forest habitats on opposite sides of the Australian continent. Finally, morphological distinctiveness of Tasmanian populations of Brown Thornbills could reflect character displacement in sympatry with the ecologically similar Tasmanian Thornbills. Collectively, the combined morphological, genetic, and ecological evidence points to diverse evolutionary processes operating across this closely related group of birds.",2020,2020-01-20 00:54:25,2020-07-13 06:53:55,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/jzs.12355,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/J5K9YNIH/Coman et al. - 2020 - Biotic and abiotic drivers of evolution in some Au.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; Climate Data,10.1111/jzs.12355,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0947-5745,1439-0469",0947-5745,Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research,Wiley,2020-01-13,2020,"Biotic and abiotic drivers of evolution in some Australian thornbills (Passeriformes: Acanthiza ) in allopatry, sympatry, and parapatry including a case of character displacement",2021-05-24T13:39:49.038075,

Understanding how germination of threatened species with complex dormancy patterns will be affected by climate change is a priority for their management. By exploring the effects of temperature on germination for six Persoonia species ranging in rareness, this study aims to improve ex situ plant production and better understand the probable impacts of climate change on persistence of local populations. Location South-eastern Australia. Methods The role of temperature on seed dormancy was explored using generalized additive models to predict germination probabilities for six Persoonia species ranging in rarity. Embryos were exposed to 24-hr cycles of alternating 12-hr warmer/light and 12-hr cooler/dark combinations of temperatures between 8°C and 45°C. Optimal temperature conditions for germination were determined, and spatiotemporal changes in germination probability were predicted in response to expected temperatures under future climate change scenarios. Results Unique germination niches representing complex responses across diurnal regimes were identified for each species. Germination probability was predicted to decline in four species in response to warmer day or night temperatures and in two species in response to cooler day or night temperatures. Across bioregions, areas of likely germination largely aligned with species-specific temperature sensitivity, with suitable germination niche declining in four species, one staying roughly the same and one increasing in physical range under predicted climate warming. Main conclusions In response to increased temperatures associated with climate change, germination probability varied from current rates. These changes were quantified both spatially and temporally and highlight expected challenges for persistence of some populations, particularly range restricted and rare species. Current understanding of extinction threat must consider future conditions, and these results highlight the urgent need to protect populations of these six Persoonia species that are currently threatened by habitat destruction and encourage future population persistence through restoration efforts.",2020,2020-03-01 23:25:52,2020-07-13 06:51:50,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/ddi.13040,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/BL8M4ZL7/Catelotti et al. - 2020 - Thermal germination niches of Persoonia species an.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records; Climate Data,10.1111/ddi.13040,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,"1366-9516,1472-4642",1366-9516,Diversity and Distributions,Wiley,2020-02-19,2020,Thermal germination niches of Persoonia species and projected spatiotemporal shifts under a changing climate,2021-04-23T05:35:56.896953,

The present study documents poleward movements of up to eight species of nominally ‘tropical’ macroinvertebrates (molluscs, polychaetes, crustaceans and foraminifera) from intertidal mudflats on the south east coast of Australia. The speed of movement was comparable with that for Australian marine fauna generally, but was particularly fast for worms and molluscs (∼70–300 km decade−1) and may be facilitated by the southward flowing East Australia Current. Further, two temperate taxa appear to have extended their ranges northwards. Changes in species biogeographic ranges raises questions surrounding the response of ecological processes within the altered and novel species combinations, including processes that underpin valuable ecosystem services. Using biological traits analysis to investigate how the observed species range changes might have impacted mudflat ecosystem functioning, and to predict the possible impacts of further poleward movements of tropical taxa. Our models suggest the changes to date, and those likely to occur in the near future, are within the envelope whereby ecological functioning is maintained by functional compensation and redundancy within the mudflat assemblage. However, in the most extreme scenario the replacement of temperate by tropical taxa resulted in major changes in ecological functioning with potential impacts on nutrient cycling and C-cycling, undermining the potential of these mudflats to continue to deliver critical ecosystem services.

Hover flies (Syrphidae: Diptera) are a cosmopolitan group of insects that provide important ecosystem services including pollination and pest control. The seasonal migration of hover flies is probably best known in Europe, but it remains unstudied in many other parts of the world. 2. Australia is believed to be home to around 160 hover fly species, some of which are common in urban and agricultural environments. The current evidence for hover fly migration in Australia is scarce and anecdotal, yet migration may be critical to the success of pollination and the biological control of aphids. 3. In this study, species occurrence records from an online biodiversity database (Atlas of Living Australia) were used to look for evidence of migratory behaviours in all Australian hover flies with more than 200 occurrence records. 4. Four of the 10 species displayed seasonal changes in their distribution consistent with migration, including Australia's two most abundant species: Melangyna viridiceps and Simosyrphus grandicornis. This work is an important first step in understanding the prevalence of migration in Australian hover flies. However, confirmation of our findings requires additional evidence to rule out other plausible explanations for the observed patterns. 5. Based on changes in summer and winter latitudinal distribution, it is estimated that some Australian hover flies may make annual migrations of 400–1800 km. 6.

Newspaper reports from 1875 onwards show that on European settlement, wallaby populations were confined to eastern Victoria, including the ranges around Melbourne, the Otway Ranges and Portland District of south-western Victoria, and a tiny part of south-eastern South Australia. Populations contracted further with intense hunting for the fur trade until the 1930s. In the late 1970s, however, wallabies began spreading into drier habitats than those initially recorded. Possible causes underlying this change in distribution are discussed; some seem unlikely but, because wallabies began spreading soon after the introduction of European rabbit fleas as vectors of myxomatosis, the cumulative effects of releases of biological agents to control rabbits appear important.

Poorly estimating species’ ranges can lead to underestimation of threatened status, undervaluing of remaining habitat and misdirection of conservation funding. We aimed to evaluate the utility of a SDM, similar to the models used to inform government regulation of habitat in our study region, in estimating the contemporary distribution of a threatened and declining species. We developed a presence-only SDM for the endangered New Holland Mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae) across Victoria, Australia. We conducted extensive camera trap surveys across model-predicted and expert-selected areas to generate an independent data set for use in evaluating the model, determining confidence in absence data from non-detection sites with occupancy and detectability modelling. We assessed the predictive capacity of the model at thresholds based on (1) sum of sensitivity and specificity (SSS), and (2) the lowest presence threshold (LPT; i.e. the lowest non-zero model-predicted habitat suitability value at which we detected the species). We detected P. novaehollandiae at 40 of 472 surveyed sites, with strong support for the species’ probable absence from non-detection sites. Based on our post hoc optimised SSS threshold of the SDM, 25% of our detection sites were falsely predicted as non-suitable habitat and 75% of sites predicted as suitable habitat did not contain the species at the time of our survey. One occupied site had a model-predicted suitability value of zero, and at the LPT, 88% of sites predicted as suitable habitat did not contain the species at the time of our survey. Our findings demonstrate that application of generic SDMs in both regulatory and investment contexts should be tempered by considering their limitations and currency.

Our hypothesis is that speciation in this group has been largely allopatric at regional scale, but involved morphological divergence at local scale through sympatric character displacement. Location Australia, New Guinea and surrounding islands. Taxon Dasyurid (Dasyuridae) marsupials, 67 species. Methods Geographical range overlap was quantified using polygons representing the outer limits of species distributions. Local-scale range overlap was quantified as the degree of co-occurrence of two taxa across a set of ecological survey plots representing 83 sampled communities. Phylogenies were generated using a novel DNA dataset, with divergence times estimated via total-evidence dating incorporating fossils. Morphological divergence was determined using body mass and lower molar row length as proxy traits for reconstructing niche exploitation. Results Sister species pairs were found to be sympatric in 52% (11/21) of cases. Range overlap tended to increase with node age, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian speciation is routinely allopatric. We detected no evidence of character displacement with increasing range overlap between sister species pairs. However, a negative relationship was observed between morphological divergence in body mass and range overlap across all sampled taxa, suggesting that selection in sympatry is convergent, while divergent selection occurs in allopatry. Local-scale co-occurrences revealed no trace of species aversion, indicating that competition has not impacted on the spatial distribution of dasyurids. Main conclusions Despite moderate levels of sympatry through time, our results evince low rates of spatial co-occurrence between dasyurid species. Although this may be indicative competitive exclusion, the lack of character displacement suggests that biotic interactions have likely not acted as a dominant driver of phenotypic evolution in this radiation.

We used a common garden approach to measure growth and survival under warming. We tested for the effects of evolutionary history by investigating phylogeny and testing for a phylogenetic signal, and for the effects of ecological history by considering climatic variables associated with species distributions in their native range. Evolutionary history did not have a detectable effect on warming responses. While there was a moderate signal for plant growth in the absence of warming, there was no signal for growth changes in response to warming, despite variability among species to warming that ranged from positive to negative growth responses. There was no strong effect of climate context, as species that showed a positive response to warming did not necessarily originate from hotter environments. In fact, several species from hot environments grew relatively poorly when exposed to higher soil temperature. However, species endemic to alpine areas were less likely to benefit from warming than widespread species. We found a strong phylogenetic signal for climate history, in that closely related species tend to occur in areas with similar annual variability in precipitation. Species differences in response to soil warming were variable and difficult to link to climate conditions except for the poor response of alpine endemics.

Understanding their capacity to respond to climate change is essential for conserving biodiversity and determining appropriate restoration seed sources. Patterns of local adaptation to climate between populations within a species can inform such conservation decisions and are often investigated from either a quantitative trait or molecular genetic basis. Here, we present findings from a combined analysis of phenotype (quantitative genetic analysis), genotype (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) trait associations), and climate associations. We draw on the strength of this combined approach to investigate pre-existing climate adaptation and its genetic basis in Eucalyptus microcarpa (Grey box), an important tree for ecological restoration in south-eastern Australia. Phenotypic data from a 26-year-old provenance trial demonstrated significant genetic variation in growth and leaf traits at both the family and provenance levels. Growth traits were only associated with temperature, whilst leaf traits were associated with temperature, precipitation and aridity. Genotyping of 40 putatively adaptive SNPs from previous genome-wide analyses identified 9 SNPs associated with these traits. Drawing on previous SNP&ndash;climate association results, several associations were identified between all three comparisons of phenotype, genotype and climate. By combining phenotypic with genomic analyses, these results corroborate genomic findings and enhance understanding of climate adaptation in E. microcarpa.

Predicting the impact of climate change on the current and future distributions of these unwanted species forms an important category of ecological research. Our study investigated 32 globally important IWS to assess whether climate alteration may lead to spatial changes in the overlapping of specific IWS globally. We utilized the versatile species distribution model MaxEnt, coupled with Geographic Information Systems, to evaluate the potential alterations (gain/loss/static) in the number of potential ecoregion invasions by IWS, under four Representative Concentration Pathways, which differ in terms of predicted year of peak greenhouse gas emission. We based our projection on a forecast of climatic variables (extracted from WorldClim) from two global circulation models (CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM). Initially, we modeled current climatic suitability of habitat, individually for each of the 32 IWS, identifying those with a common spatial range of suitability. Thereafter, we modeled the suitability of all 32 species under the projected climate for 2050, incorporating each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) in separate models, again examining the common spatial overlaps. The discrimination capacity and accuracy of the model were assessed for all 32 IWS individually, using the area under the curve and true skill statistic rate, with results averaging 0.87 and 0.75 respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy. Our final methodological step compared the extent of the overlaps and alterations under the current and future projected climates. Our results mainly predicted decrease on a global scale, in areas of habitat suitable for most IWS, under future climatic conditions, excluding European countries, northern Brazil, eastern US, and south-eastern Australia. The following should be considered when interpreting these results: there are many inherent assumptions and limitations in presence-only data of this type, as well as with the modeling techniques projecting climate conditions, and the envelopes themselves, such as scale and resolution mismatches, dispersal barriers, lack of documentation on potential disturbances, and unknown or unforeseen biotic interactions.",2020,2020-05-20 07:15:02,2020-07-13 06:17:00,,106436,,,116,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106436,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/RTWJR6FH/Shabani et al. - 2020 - Invasive weed species’ threats to global biodivers.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106436,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,1470-160X,1470-160X,Ecological Indicators,Elsevier BV,2020-09-01,2020,Invasive weed species’ threats to global biodiversity: Future scenarios of changes in the number of invasive species in a changing climate,2021-04-22T06:18:20.519322,

Methods suggested to reduce overfitting include increasing regularisation, using only linear and quadratic features, or applying forward selection of predictors using maximum likelihood (ML) methods. We built models using these options to determine environmental suitability within existing aquaculture zones for eight seaweed species, four red (Rhodophyta: Florideophyceae) and four brown (Ochrophyta: Phaeophyceae), that are being investigated for aquaculture in southern Australia. Forward selection models were the most parsimonious, but we encountered failure of ML methods for Pterocladia lucida (Rhodophyta) due to separation. Separation is a known issue for logistic regression and has recently been recognised in maxent models. Separation occurs where a variable, or combination of variables, is a perfect predictor for a binary response, here, species occurrence, and results in ML parameter estimates tending to infinity. One method for obtaining finite parameter estimates under separation is to apply a Cauchy prior distribution for coefficients. We therefore also built models for each species using a Cauchy-prior version of the forward selection method, and found that these models performed similarly to those built with ML methods. Default models achieved marginally higher predictive performance than other options based on training data metrics, but simpler models performed equivalently to, or better than, default models at predicting independent presence-absence test data. Predictive performance using test data varied considerably between species, but the difference in performance between models within each species was generally small. Our results confirm the concern that default maxent models may suffer from over-fitting and poor transferability. Model transferability and interpretability were important for our purpose, hence, based on the principle of parsimony, forward selection models were preferred. We also found that forward selection models retained similar predictive performance to the best model as assessed by each metric, further supporting use of these models. Where ML methods failed due to separation, the use of the Cauchy-prior method was a viable alternative. Predictions for the region of interest (Spencer Gulf, South Australia) were generated using the most parsimonious models, and Solieria robusta (Rhodophyta) showed the highest predicted suitability of the eight candidate species within existing aquaculture zones, especially in northern Spencer Gulf. Predicted suitability was low for the other Rhodophyta considered, while each of the Phaeophyceae showed moderate to high suitability in at least some southern Spencer Gulf aquaculture zones.

Each of these functions could affect a plant's ability to tolerate the biotic and abiotic stresses encountered in different parts of the world. However, we know remarkably little about large scale biogeographic patterns in leaf pubescence. Our aims were: (a) to determine whether a higher proportion of species have pubescence at sites where it is hot, dry and solar radiation is high, and (b) to quantify the latitudinal gradient in pubescence. Location Australia. Taxon Vascular land plants. Methods We compiled data on the presence/absence of pubescence on mature photosynthetic organs for 4,183 species, spanning 107 families. We combined these data with over 1.9 million species occurrence records from the Atlas of Living Australia to calculate the proportion of species with pubescence in 3,261 grid cells spanning the Australian continent. Results The proportion of pubescent species was most closely related to solar radiation (R2 = 0.33), followed by maximum temperature in the warmest month (R2 = 0.30). Mean annual precipitation was very weakly related to pubescence (R2 = 0.01). We found a significant negative relationship between latitude and pubescence (R2 = 0.19), with the average percentage of species with pubescence dropping from 46% at 10° S to 35% at 44° S. This cross-species relationship remained significant after accounting for phylogenetic relationships between species. We found that a quadratic model explained more variation in pubescence across latitudes than did a linear model. The quadratic model shows a peak in the proportion of pubescent species at 19° S (within the tropics). Main conclusions Our findings are consistent with the idea that leaf pubescence may have a protective function in areas with high solar radiation and high temperatures. Our data are also consistent with the idea that species towards the tropics should be better defended than are species at higher latitudes.",2020,2020-06-02 06:07:16,2020-07-13 06:16:17,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/jbi.13870,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/7QIW8UKQ/Moles et al. - 2020 - A hairy situation Plant species in warm, sunny pl.pdf",,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records,10.1111/jbi.13870,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0305-0270,1365-2699",0305-0270,Journal of Biogeography,Wiley,2020-05-26,2020,"A hairy situation: Plant species in warm, sunny places are more likely to have pubescent leaves",2021-12-03T16:48:26.768274,

Examples of each research area are used to examine potential crossovers, limitations of the methods, and future requirements.

Interactions vary from agonistic to cooperative and should result in predictable patterns in trait and range evolution. However, despite a conceptual understanding of these processes, they have been difficult to model, particularly on macroevolutionary timescales and across broad geographic spaces. Here we investigate the influence of biotic interactions on trait evolution and community assembly in monitor lizards (Varanus). Monitors are an iconic radiation with a cosmopolitan distribution and the greatest size disparity of any living terrestrial vertebrate genus. Between the colossal Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis and the smallest Australian dwarf goannas, Varanus length and mass vary by multiple orders of magnitude. To test the hypothesis that size variation in this genus was driven by character displacement, we extended existing phylogenetic comparative methods which consider lineage interactions to account for dynamic biogeographic history and apply these methods to Australian monitors and marsupial predators. Incorporating both exon-capture molecular and morphological datasets we use a combined evidence approach to estimate the relationships among living and extinct varaniform lizards. Our results suggest that communities of Australian Varanus show high functional diversity as a result of continent-wide interspecific competition among monitors but not with faunivorous marsupials. We demonstrate that patterns of trait evolution resulting from character displacement on continental scales are recoverable from comparative data and highlight that these macroevolutionary patterns may develop in parallel across widely distributed sympatric groups.",2020,2020-06-23 04:25:24,2020-07-13 06:15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1093/sysbio/syaa046,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/VIB3KD2K/Brennan et al. - Phylogenomics of monitor lizards and the role of c.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records,10.1093/sysbio/syaa046,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"1063-5157,1076-836X",1063-5157,Systematic Biology,Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-06-10,2020,Phylogenomics of Monitor Lizards and the Role of Competition in Dictating Body Size Disparity,2021-01-31T05:41:08.213047,

The global prevalence of diabetes is estimated at 425 million people in 2017, and expected to rise to 629 million by 2045 due to an increasing trend of unhealthy lifestyles, physical inactivity, and obesity. Several treatment options are available to diabetics, however, some of the antidiabetic drugs result in adverse side effects such as hypoglycemia. Hence, there has been a proliferation of studies on natural products with antidiabetic effects, including plants from the Myrtaceae family, such as Psidium guajava, Eucalyptus globulus, Campomanesia xanthocarpa, and more significantly, Syzygium sp.

We aimed to quantify changes in herbivory and defense in introduced plants while controlling for three factors that might have confounded past studies: using a wide native range for comparison with the introduced range, measuring defense traits without determining whether they affect herbivore preferences, and not considering the effect of time since introduction. The first hypothesis we tested was that introduced plants will have evolved lower levels of plant defense compared to their source population. We grew South African (source) and Australian (introduced) beach daisies (Arctotheca populifolia) in a common-environment glasshouse experiment and measured seven defense traits. Introduced plants had more ash, alkaloids, and leaf hairs than source plants, but were also less tough, with a lower C:N ratio and less phenolics. Overall, we found no difference in defense between source and introduced plants. To determine whether the feeding habits of herbivores align with changes in defense traits, we conducted preference feeding trials using five different herbivore species. Herbivores showed no overall preference for leaves from either group. The second hypothesis we tested was that herbivory on introduced plant species will increase through time after introduction to a new range. We recorded leaf damage on herbarium specimens of seven species introduced to eastern Australia and three native control species. We found no change in the overall level of herbivory experienced by introduced plants since arriving in Australia. Conclusion In the field of invasion ecology, we need to rethink the paradigm that species introduced to a new range undergo simple decreases in defenses against herbivores. Instead, plants are likely to employ a range of defense traits that evolve in both coordinated and opposing ways in response to a plethora of different biotic and abiotic selective pressures.",2020,2020-07-01 06:30:25,2020-07-01 06:31:15,,5451-5463,,12,10,,,,,,,en,,,,,Scopus,,10.1002/ece3.6288,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/B3WKLUP7/Brandenburger et al. - 2020 - Evolution of defense and herbivory in introduced p.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,10.1002/ece3.6288,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"2045-7758,2045-7758",2045-7758,Ecology and Evolution,Wiley,2020-05-05,2020,"Evolution of defense and herbivory in introduced plants—Testing enemy release using a known source population, herbivore trials, and time since introduction",2021-11-26T20:05:15.000022,

Four different techniques were then tested for their effect on dormancy: (i) incubation of intact seeds on agar incorporating gibberellic acid (GA3); (ii) seed coat removal (decoating); (iii) scarification near the radicle emergence point (scarification-emergence point); and (iv) scarification opposite the radicle emergence point (scarification-back). Imbibition tests were performed to determine whether dormancy was due to an impermeable seed coat. Germination differed among treatments, but all three species showed a similar pattern. Intact seeds showed < 6% germination after one month indicating the presence of dormancy. Highest germination (> 65%) was observed following scarification-emergence point treatment. Seed coat removal also resulted in increased germination (40-47%), in comparison with intact seeds, but GA3 and scarification-back treatments did not (< 12%). Though the seedcoats of all species were permeable, increased germination responses to decoating and scarification-emergence point treatments suggest scarification is required to clear the radicle emergence point.

Through extensive exhibits and public programming and by hosting rich communities of amateurs, students, and researchers at all stages of their careers, they can provide a place-based window to focus on integration of science and discovery, as well as a locus for community engagement. At the same time, like a synthesis radio telescope, when joined together through emerging digital resources, the global community of museums (the ‘Global Museum’) is more than the sum of its parts, allowing insights and answers to diverse biological, environmental, and societal questions at the global scale, across eons of time, and spanning vast diversity across the Tree of Life. We argue that, whereas natural history collections and museums began with a focus on describing the diversity and peculiarities of species on Earth, they are now increasingly leveraged in new ways that significantly expand their impact and relevance. These new directions include the possibility to ask new, often interdisciplinary questions in basic and applied science, such as in biomimetic design, and by contributing to solutions to climate change, global health and food security challenges. As institutions, they have long been incubators for cutting-edge research in biology while simultaneously providing core infrastructure for research on present and future societal needs. Here we explore how the intersection between pressing issues in environmental and human health and rapid technological innovation have reinforced the relevance of museum collections. We do this by providing examples as food for thought for both the broader academic community and museum scientists on the evolving role of museums. We also identify challenges to the realization of the full potential of natural history collections and the Global Museum to science and society and discuss the critical need to grow these collections. We then focus on mapping and modelling of museum data (including place-based approaches and discovery), and explore the main projects, platforms and databases enabling this growth.

One of the most rapidly expanding invasive plants in recent times is Kalanchoe × houghtonii (Crassulaceae), an artificial hybrid created in the 1930s in the United States by experimental crossings between K. daigremontiana and K. tubiflora, two species endemic to Madagascar. Thanks to its large colonizing capacity (mainly derived from the production of asexual plantlets), K. × houghtonii soon escaped from cultivation and quickly spread in many parts of the world. However, its actual range is not well known due to the lack of a formal description until recent times (2006) and its strong morphological resemblance with one of its parentals (K. daigremontiana). The present study was aimed, in the first instance, to delimit the present distribution area of K. × houghtonii at the global scale by gathering and validating all its occurrences and to track its colonization history. Currently, K. × houghtonii can be found on all continents except Antarctica, although it did not reach a global distribution until the 2000s. Its potential distribution, estimated with MaxEnt modelling software, is mainly centered in subtropical regions, from 20° to 40° of both northern and southern latitudes, mostly in areas with a high anthropogenic activity. Unexpectedly, concomitant to a poleward migration, future niche models suggest a considerable reduction of its range by up to one-third compared to the present, which might be related with the Crassulaceaean Acid Metabolism (CAM) of K. × houghtonii.

One extant subpopulation is relatively secure within a closed water catchment in the Kedumba Valley. However, the other main subpopulation, which once probably had a more-extensive distribution along the Nepean River, is now fragmented due to clearing for agriculture and urban development. This has impacted on reproductive success and recruitment. Planting of trees in urbanised areas and other locations along the Nepean River has been ongoing for over 20 years and is an important circa situm conservation measure. Government policy has been to plant trees that are of local provenance, however it is difficult to know whether this policy has been properly implemented: it is possible that planting stock may have been sourced from the Kedumba subpopulation. Microsatellite markers were used to examine the probable origins and kinship of 133 planted trees from 15 planted sites around Camden, NSW. Population assignment confirmed that the majority of planted trees are probably from the local Nepean River subpopulation, although some were identified that are very likely to have originated from the Kedumba Valley. While the overall diversity of the planted trees is high, kinship within individual planted stands is often elevated, increasing the potential for inbreeding and limiting their usefulness as seed sources.

To do this, they present three walking maps of plants imagined as ‘tropical’ growing in Marrickville, a suburb in Gadigal-Wangal Country in Sydney’s inner west, an area located in the ‘sub-tropical humid’ climate zone map. Through the generation of three plant-led walking maps, they reveal recombinant Marrickville ecologies.

Understanding the dynamics of transmission is important for disease prevention efforts, but is dependent on disentangling complex interactions within coupled natural systems. Ross River virus (RRV) is a multivector multihost pathogen responsible for the greatest number of notified vector-borne pathogen infections in humans in Australia. Current evidence suggests that nonhuman vertebrates are critical for the maintenance and spillover of RRV into mosquito populations. Yet, there is a limited knowledge of which mosquito vector species and amplifying vertebrate host species are most important for transmission of RRV to humans. We conducted field surveys of nonhuman vertebrates and mosquitoes in the RRV endemic city of Brisbane, Australia, to assess the effect of vector and host community structure on human RRV notifications. Six suburbs were selected across a gradient of human disease notification rates. Differences in vertebrate and mosquito compositions were observed across all suburbs. Suburbs with higher RRV notification rates contained greater vertebrate biomass (dominated by the presence of horses) and higher mosquito abundances. This study suggests that horse–mosquito interactions should be considered in more detail and that vertebrate biomass and mosquito abundance be incorporated into future RRV modeling studies and considered in public health strategies for RRV management.",2020,2020-05-11 02:45:10,2020-05-11 02:45:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1089/vbz.2019.2585,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/J372VE7F/Skinner et al. - 2020 - Associations Between Ross River Virus Infection in.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,10.1089/vbz.2019.2585,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1530-3667,1557-7759",1530-3667,Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases,Mary Ann Liebert Inc,2020-09-01,2020,"Associations Between Ross River Virus Infection in Humans and Vector-Vertebrate Community Ecology in Brisbane, Australia",2021-01-18T23:23:56.025749,

Effective control overseas depends on maximising the impact of natural enemies. Problems with polyphagous Liriomyza pest species typically result from the destruction of their parasitoids by excessive use of non-selective insecticides. Field studies are reviewed to identify parasitoid species involved in the biological control of L. sativae in open-air and glasshouse production internationally and to assess the current knowledge of parasitoids of agromyzids in Australia. Overseas, invading Liriomyza populations have frequently been exploited by endemic parasitoids (often found on non-pest agromyzid species), and non-crop hosts have played a role as reservoirs of these parasitoids. The few published Australian field studies on the occurrence of agromyzid flies and their parasitoids show a large community of wasps attacking agromyzids, with species mainly from the Eulophidae, Pteromalidae and Braconidae. The most abundant recorded species are two cosmopolitan eulophid species, Hemiptarsenus varicornis (Girault) and Diglyphus isaea (Walker), and four Australian species: two eulophid species, Zagrammosoma latilineatum Ubaidillah and Closterocerus mirabilis Edwards & La Salle, one pteromalid species, Trigonogastrella sp., and one braconid species, Opius cinerariae Fischer, for which there is little biological information. One deficiency in the known assemblage in Australia is the absence of parasitoids from the Eucoilinae (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), a subfamily with several abundant species attacking agromyzids overseas. The composition and impact of the endemic parasitoid assemblage in Australia on populations of L. sativae needs to be assessed adequately in the field before the importation of additional exotic parasitoid species is contemplated. Overseas, two species, D. isaea and Dacnusa sibirica Telenga, are reared commercially for augmentative biological control, although the relatively high cost of production has restricted their release to protected cropping situations. Knowledge gaps remain locally about the taxonomy, distribution, host range and life cycle of parasitoids, and their potential impact on L. sativae.",2020,2020-03-02 00:27:11,2020-05-01 06:31:00,,16-36,,1,59,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/aen.12444,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/L4ETGQIF/Ridland et al. - 2020 - Potential for biological control of the vegetable .pdf,,4 - ALA acknowledged,10.1111/aen.12444,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"2052-174X,2052-1758",2052-174X,Austral Entomology,Wiley,2020-02-01,2020,"Potential for biological control of the vegetable leafminer, Liriomyza sativae (Diptera: Agromyzidae), in Australia with parasitoid wasps",2021-12-20T08:47:22.842571,

Biodiversity hotspots were then identified on the basis of coincidence of high values of species richness, endemic richness and weighted endemism. Spatial and environmental variables accounting for significant variation in species and endemic richness were determined using multivariate generalized linear models. Broad patterns of species and endemic richness showed a pronounced north-south latitudinal gradient that was significantly correlated with mean annual rainfall, from the wetter northern coastal areas to the drier southern inland areas of the semi-arid zone. Analysis of weighted endemism identified three putative centers of endemism: the Top End (north-western corner), the Kimberley (northern) and Arnhem Land (Gove Peninsula). Overall, the north-western corner of the Top End (86,860 km2) – including the Arnhem Land Plateau (Kakadu NP-Nitmiluk NP and Warddeken IPA), reserves in the Darwin region, Litchfield NP, the Tiwi Islands, Fish River-Daly River, and Cobourg Peninsula (Garig Gunak Barlu NP) – is a major biodiversity hotspot for the conservation of diurnal Lepidoptera based on congruent patterns of species richness, endemic richness and weighted endemism.

During 2016–2017, in both dry and wet seasons a total of 3320 leaf samples were collected from diverse types of sites on cultivated and uncultivated land and 1248 (38 %) of them were from aphid-colonized plants. In addition, aphids were found at 236 of 355 sampling sites. The 62 plant species sampled came from 23 families 19 of which contained aphid-colonized species. Aphid hosts included introduced weeds, Australian native plants, and volunteer or planted crop plants. Six aphid species were identified by light microscopy and CO1 gene sequencing, but there was no within species nucleotide sequence diversity.

The success of such projects is highly variable. Risk factors may be readily identifiable in a general sense, but it is rarely clear how they play out individually, or in combination. We addressed this problem with a field experiment on the survival of, and browsing damage to, 1275 hand-planted buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) seedlings in a nationally endangered, semi-arid woodland community. Buloke seedlings were planted in 17 sites representing four landscape contexts and with three levels of protection from kangaroo and lagomorph browsing. We censused seedlings and measured herbivore activity four times during the first 400 d post-planting and fitted models of mortality and browse hazard to these data using survival analysis. Increasing lagomorph activity was associated with higher mortality risk, while kangaroo activity was not. Seedling survival was lowest for each treatment within extant buloke woodland, and the highest survival rates for guarded seedlings were in locations favored by lagomorphs. Damage from browsing was nearly ubiquitous after one year for surviving unguarded seedlings, despite moderate browser activity. On average, unguarded seedlings showed a decline in height, whereas fully guarded seedlings grew 2.3 cm across the survey period.

But estimates of species richness for a given place are often imprecise and incomplete, even when derived from expert-validated range maps. The current uptake of citizen science in natural resource management, conservation, and ecology offers great potential for extensive data to define species occurrence and richness patterns in the future. Yet, studies are needed to validate these richness patterns and ensure these data are fit-for-purpose. We compared data from a continental-scale citizen science project—FrogID—with expert-derived range maps to assess how well the former predicts species richness patterns in space. We then investigated how many citizen science submissions are necessary to fully sample the underlying frog community. There was a strong positive association between citizen science species richness estimates and estimates derived from an expert-derived map of frog distributions. An average of 153 citizen science submissions were necessary to fully-sample frog richness based on the expert-derived frog richness. Sampling effort in the citizen science project was negatively correlated with the remoteness of an area: less remote areas were more likely to have a greater number of citizen science submissions and be fully sampled. This suggests that scientists will likely need to rely on professionals for data collection in remote regions. We conclude that a citizen science project that has been running for ~ 18 months, can accurately predict frog species richness at a continental scale compared with an expert-derived map based on ~ 240 years of data accumulation. At large-scales, biodiversity data derived from citizen science projects will likely play a prominent role in the future of biodiversity and conservation.",2020,2020-03-01 23:14:54,2020-05-01 05:48:44,,1323-1337,,4,29,,,,,,,en,,,,,ProQuest,,10.1007/s10531-020-01937-3,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/GIXTN5XC/Callaghan et al. - 2020 - Citizen science data accurately predicts expert-de.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

They are the basis for human well-being, providing food, materials and medicines. Specimens of all three groups of organisms are accommodated in herbaria, where they are commonly referred to as botanical specimens.The large number of specimens in herbaria provides an ample, permanent and continuously improving knowledge base on these organisms and an indispensable source for the analysis of the distribution of species in space and time critical for current and future research relating to global biodiversity. In order to make full use of this resource, a research infrastructure has to be built that grants comprehensive and free access to the information in herbaria and botanical collections in general. This can be achieved through digitization of the botanical objects and associated data.The botanical research community can count on a long-standing tradition of collaboration among institutions and individuals. It agreed on data standards and standard services even before the advent of computerization and information networking, an example being the Index Herbariorum as a global registry of herbaria helping towards the unique identification of specimens cited in the literature.In the spirit of this collaborative history, 51 representatives from 30 institutions advocate to start the digitization of botanical collections with the overall wall-to-wall digitization of the flat objects stored in German herbaria. Germany has 70 herbaria holding almost 23 million specimens according to a national survey carried out in 2019. 87% of these specimens are not yet digitized. Experiences from other countries like France, the Netherlands, Finland, the US and Australia show that herbaria can be comprehensively and cost-efficiently digitized in a relatively short time due to established workflows and protocols for the high-throughput digitization of flat objects.Most of the herbaria are part of a university (34), fewer belong to municipal museums (10) or state museums (8), six herbaria belong to institutions also supported by federal funds such as Leibniz institutes, and four belong to non-governmental organizations. A common data infrastructure must therefore integrate different kinds of institutions.Making full use of the data gained by digitization requires the set-up of a digital infrastructure for storage, archiving, content indexing and networking as well as standardized access for the scientific use of digital objects. A standards-based portfolio of technical components has already been developed and successfully tested by the Biodiversity Informatics Community over the last two decades, comprising among others access protocols, collection databases, portals, tools for semantic enrichment and annotation, international networking, storage and archiving in accordance with international standards. This was achieved through the funding by national and international programs and initiatives, which also paved the road for the German contribution to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).Herbaria constitute a large part of the German botanical collections that also comprise living collections in botanical gardens and seed banks, DNA- and tissue samples, specimens preserved in fluids or on microscope slides and more. Once the herbaria are digitized, these resources can be integrated, adding to the value of the overall research infrastructure. The community has agreed on tasks that are shared between the herbaria, as the German GBIF model already successfully demonstrates.We have compiled nine scientific use cases of immediate societal relevance for an integrated infrastructure of botanical collections. They address accelerated biodiversity discovery and research, biomonitoring and conservation planning, biodiversity modelling, the generation of trait information, automated image recognition by artificial intelligence, automated pathogen detection, contextualization by interlinking objects, enabling provenance research, as well as education, outreach and citizen science.We propose to start this initiative now in order to valorize German botanical collections as a vital part of a worldwide biodiversity data pool.",2020,2020-02-10 04:23:55,2020-05-01 03:55:43,,e50675,,,6,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.3897/rio.6.e50675,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/ZLGVTXCN/Borsch et al. - 2020 - A complete digitization of German herbaria is poss.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,10.3897/rio.6.e50675,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2367-7163,2367-7163,Research Ideas and Outcomes,Pensoft Publishers,2020-02-03,2020,"A complete digitization of German herbaria is possible, sensible and should be started now",2021-05-17T20:51:28.530803,

However, individual coagulation factor activities in dogs with tiger snake envenomation have not been determined. This study aimed to characterise VICC and the time course of recovery in tiger snake envenomed dogs and to investigate an association between tiger snake venom (TSV) concentrations and factor activity. Methods This was a prospective, observational, cohort study. The study cohort was 11 dogs of any age, breed, sex, body weight >10 kg, confirmed serum TSV on ELISA and treated with antivenom. Blood was collected at enrolment before antivenom administration, then at 3, 12 and 24 h after antivenom administration. Tiger snake venom concentrations were detected with a sandwich ELISA. Fibrinogen was measured using a modified Clauss method, and coagulation factors (F) II, V, VII, VIII and X were measured with factor-deprived human plasma using a modified prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) method. Linear mixed models, with multiple imputations of censored observations, were used to determine the effect of time and TSV concentration on the coagulation times and factor activity. This cohort was compared to 20 healthy controls. Results At enrolment, there were severe deficiencies in fibrinogen, FV and FVIII, with predicted recovery by 10.86, 11.75 and 13.14 h after antivenom, respectively. There were modest deficiencies in FX and FII, with predicted recovery by 20.57 and 32.49 h after antivenom, respectively. No changes were detected in FVII. Prothrombin time and aPTT were markedly prolonged with predicted recovery of aPTT by 12.58 h. Higher serum TSV concentrations were associated with greater deficiencies in FII, FV and FVIII, and greater prolongations in coagulation times. The median (range) serum TSV concentration was 57 (6–2295) ng/mL. Conclusions In tiger snake envenomed dogs, we detected a profound, TSV-concentration-related consumption of select coagulation factors, that rapidly recovered toward normal. These findings allowed further insight into tiger snake VICC in dogs.",2020,2020-04-28 01:51:36,2020-04-28 01:53:01,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.03.010,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/5TNG2IJR/Eramanis et al. - 2020 - Coagulation factor activity patterns of venom-indu.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.03.010,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0041-0101,0041-0101,Toxicon,Elsevier BV,2020-07-01,2020,Coagulation factor activity patterns of venom-induced consumption coagulopathy in naturally occurring tiger snake (Notechis scutatus) envenomed dogs treated with antivenom,2021-01-17T17:29:37.514520,

Approaches to production are needed that are holistic and multisectoral. In planning for future agricultural models, it is worth exploring indigenous agricultural heritage systems that have demonstrated success in community food security without major environmental impacts. We demonstrate how indigenous practices of customary harvest, operating in multifunctional landscapes, can be scaled up to service new markets while still maintaining natural and cultural values. We do this through a case analysis of the wild harvest of Kakadu plum fruit by Aboriginal people across the tropical savannas of northern Australia. We conclude that this system would ideally operate at a landscape scale to ensure sustainability of harvest, maintenance of important patterns and processes for landscape health, and incorporate cultural and livelihood objectives.

They do not accommodate for Indigenous or alternative knowledge frameworks. In addition, the premium placed on openness by certain platforms and licenses contradicts the approaches preferred by Indigenous knowledge authorities who tie the sharing of some types of knowledge to the identity and authority level of the intended audience. Knowledge in this context is not understood as discrete units of information that can be abstracted from their communities, easily shared on public platforms, but rather as sensitive materials that can only be shared by recognized knowledge authorities for specific purposes. The processes by which Indigenous knowledge authorities engage with knowledge sharing on digital platforms comprise a complex landscape in which social justice concerns come into play. This paper discusses how, within institutional design contexts, open educational practice (OEP) by Northern Australian Indigenous authors can enable different forms of social justice and work incrementally towards achieving greater recognition of Indigenous intellectual sovereign acts with due respect to the wider significance of Indigenous Sovereignty (Rigney 2001).

Multiple reproductive schemes occur in social insects, from simple schemes with one founding reproductive pair, to more complex ones involving within-colony inbreeding and more than two unrelated reproductives. Colony breeding schemes and genetic structure remain understudied in termites, compared to the Hymenoptera. In this study, we performed the first genetic characterisation of the colony breeding structure of Nasutitermes exitiosus (Blattodea: Termitidae), an endemic Australian termite with a broad distribution across southern mainland Australia. We analysed the genetic structure of 60 N. exitiosus colonies from the Eastern part of its distribution, using microsatellites and mitochondrial sequence data. We found that most colonies were headed by one founding pair of reproductives, although some colonies exhibited a more complex breeding structure, including within-colony inbreeding and the presence of multiple unrelated reproductives. We found evidence for the presence of seven unrelated queens in one colony, to our knowledge, the highest number of unrelated queens yet found in a termite from the family Termitidae.

Moreover, we produced a comprehensive DNA reference library for molecular species identification and a first comprehensive molecular phylogeny for all Australian Prioninae, using mitogenomic data. The Prioninae include some of the world's largest beetles, and their long-lived larvae are major recyclers of solid dead timber, yet these longhorn beetles are rarely seen in nature due to their concealed habits, short adult lifespans and nocturnal habits. Furthermore, many species are difficult to identify using morphological characters. We applied Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing to 213 historical museum specimens, representing all morphological types of Australian Prioninae. Complete mitochondrial genomes were obtained for all genera, and at least one mitochondrial protein-coding gene (PCG) was acquired for an additional 141 specimens of Australian Prioninae. Using molecular species delimitation tools, we identified 48 new species of Australian Prioninae, nearly doubling the number of currently recognized Australian species of Prioninae.

Ants were collected from a total of 34 sites located within bands of elevation of approximately 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 m asl. Surveys were conducted in March 2013 (20 sites), November 2013 and March–April 2014 (24 sites each), and ants were sampled using five methods: pitfall traps, leaf litter extracts, Malaise traps, spraying tree trunks with pyrethroid insecticide, and timed bouts of hand collecting during the day. In total we recorded 142 ant species (described species and morphospecies) from our systematic sampling and observed an additional species, the green tree ant Oecophylla smaragdina, at the lowest elevations but not on our survey sites. With the caveat of less sampling intensity at the lowest and highest elevations, species richness peaked at 600 m asl (89 species), declined monotonically with increasing and decreasing elevation, and was lowest at 1200 m asl (33 spp.). Ant species composition progressively changed with increasing elevation, but there appeared to be two gradients of change, one from 200–600 m asl and another from 800 to 1200 m asl. Differences between the lowland and upland faunas may be driven in part by a greater representation of tropical and arboreal-nesting species in the lowlands and a greater representation of subtropical species in the highlands.

We assembled dated molecular phylogenies for the 21 most species-rich flowering plant families found across mesic temperate Australia, encompassing both SWA and SEA regions, and applied a series of diversification models to investigate responses across different groups and timescales. We show that the high richness in SWA can be attributed to a higher net rate of lineage diversification and more time for species accumulation. Different pulses of diversification were retrieved in each region. A decrease in diversification rate across major flowering plant lineages at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (ca 34 Ma) was witnessed in SEA but not in SWA. Our study demonstrates the importance of historical diversification pulses and differential responses to global events as drivers of present-day diversity.

We report on one of the few circumstances where a direct comparison of the results from an EIA vertebrate fauna survey, that did not, in our opinion, appear to conform with the EPA’s guidance statement expectations but was seemingly accepted by the EPA, and a comprehensive terrestrial vertebrate fauna salvage program were undertaken at the same site. This has enabled us to comment on the consequences of not undertaking a survey that complies with the EPA’s expectations. Excluding incursions by non-local species, bats and avian fauna, ~33% of terrestrial vertebrate fauna species recorded during the fauna salvage program were not reported as being present in the EIA survey. The relative abundance of various species differed appreciably between the fauna salvage program and the EIA survey, and an endangered species present in the project area was not identified as likely to occur. We believe these differences occurred because of a single-season EIA survey, insufficient trapping effort, a failure to survey an important fauna habitat, the presumption that a threatened species would be absent due to a lack of local records and records in the available habitat types.

However, the technique is prone to error from two major sources: i) contamination through foreign DNA entering the workflow, and ii) misidentification of DNA within the workflow. Both types of error have the potential to obscure true taxon presence or to increase taxonomic richness by incorrectly identifying taxa as present at sample sites but multiple error sources can remain unaccounted for in metabarcoding studies. Here, we use data from an eDNA metabarcoding study designed to detect vertebrate species at waterholes in Australia’s arid zone to illustrate where and how in the workflow errors can arise, and how to mitigate those errors. We detected the DNA of 36 taxa spanning 34 families, 19 orders and 5 vertebrate classes in water samples from waterholes, demonstrating the potential for eDNA metabarcoding surveys to provide rapid, non-invasive detection in remote locations, and to widely sample taxonomic diversity from aquatic through to terrestrial taxa. However, we initially identified 152 taxa in the samples, meaning there were many false positive detections. We identified the sources of these errors, allowing us to design a stepwise process to detect and remove error, and provide a template to minimise similar errors that are likely to arise in other metabarcoding studies.

We aimed to understand how relationships between the physical characteristics of macroalgal habitats and their invertebrate communities varied across spatial scales and whether general ecological patterns occurred across two countries. Location Eighteen sites across the temperate east coasts of Australia (over 1,300 km) and New Zealand (over 1,000 km), with the latitudinal gradient in the two countries overlapping by 6.73 decimal degrees. Time period January to early April 2012. Major taxa studied Three intertidal macroalgal habitats in each country and the invertebrate communities within them. Methods We measured variation in patch- and individual-level characteristics of macroalgal habitats and their invertebrate communities. Patterns in macroalgal characteristics and communities were compared across latitude, and at smaller spatial scales, and correlated with 26 abiotic environmental variables using multiple multivariate analyses. Results Separately, macroalgal habitat characteristics and communities showed unusual but consistent nonlinear latitudinal patterns, with greater similarity among sites at the edges of the sampled distribution (i.e., north and south) than at centrally located sites. Macroalgal characteristics did not correlate with a particular set of environmental variables; however, communities were structured by sea surface temperature at the country scale and by macroalgal habitat type and biomass within countries. Anthropogenic variables were also important and may have contributed to the unusual nonlinear patterns observed between macroalgal characteristics and communities across latitude. Main conclusions Our results support other studies showing that large-scale patterns can emerge from systems where there is high local-scale variability. The results show that communities within macroalgal habitats respond to both the physical characteristics of the habitat and external environmental conditions (e.g., temperature), suggesting that local-scale environmental factors, including anthropogenic stressors, may modulate environmental gradients over larger scales.",2020,2020-06-10 00:45:52,2020-07-01 02:50:23,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/ddi.13070,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/XG8EQ3FT/Lloyd et al. - 2020 - Unusual but consistent latitudinal patterns in mac.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1111/ddi.13070,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"1366-9516,1472-4642",1366-9516,Diversity and Distributions,Wiley,2020-05-29,2020,Unusual but consistent latitudinal patterns in macroalgal habitats and their invertebrate communities across two countries,2021-11-10T03:09:35.241607,

Spatial sorting theory advances that invasive species can spread via a selection-neutral process predicated on differential movement. In addition to morphology and physiology, it has been predicted that variation in exploration and activity among individuals can be crucial to this model because these behaviors enhance movement. We aimed to address the question of whether exploration and activity are associated with invasive spread using the free-ranging invasive common myna (Acridotheres tristis) in Australia, one of the most broadly distributed invasive birds globally. We radio-tracked mynas from invasion-front sites versus long-established sites in New South Wales. We quantified activity using frequent movements in familiar areas and exploration using infrequent long-distance excursive movements, while also accounting for environmental variation. We discovered that mean daily distance travelled was larger in invasion-front than in invasion-source mynas, suggesting front mynas were more active. Invasion front mynas had significantly larger exploratory home ranges, moved greater maximum daily distances, and changed roost more frequently, suggesting front mynas were also more exploratory; the results were maintained when climate was included as a covariate. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show enhanced exploration and activity in free-ranging invasion-front birds. Inter-individual variation in movement-relevant behaviors might be facilitating the ongoing Australian myna range expansion, although habitat effects cannot be fully excluded. These findings point to the potential importance of considering changes in behavior when modelling alien animal invasions and applied conservation actions.",2020,2020-05-20 07:13:53,2020-07-01 02:44:27,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1007/s10530-020-02269-7,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/FKDG96GB/Burstal et al. - 2020 - Radiotracking invasive spread Are common mynas mo.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Most perennials are classified as xerophytes, and have structures that limit water loss during dry weather, provide structural support to help prevent cell collapse during dry periods or store water in photosynthetic tissues. Some of these traits are also found in sclerophyllous plants and traits that may have developed due to evolution of taxa on nutrient poor soils may also benefit the plants under arid conditions. We examined the morpho-anatomical features of photosynthetic organs of three tree and four shrub species with reduced leaves or photosynthetic stems that occur in arid or semiarid sites in Australia to see if there were patterns of tissue formation particularly associated with xeromorphy. In addition, we reviewed information on succulent and resurrection species. In the tree species (Callitris spp.) with decurrent leaves clothing the stems, the close association between the water transport system and stomata, along with anisotropic physiology would allow the species to fix carbon under increasingly dry conditions in contrast to more broad-leaved species. The shrub species (Tetratheca species and Glischrocaryon flavescens) with photosynthetic stems had extensive sclerenchyma and very dense chlorenchyma. The lack of major anatomical differences between leafless species of Tetratheca from arid areas compared with more mesic sites indicates that quite extreme morphological modifications may not exclude species from growing successfully in competition with species from less arid areas. The sclerophyll flora now characteristic of Australian vegetation from seasonally arid climates may have evolved during mesic times in the past but with relatively minor modifications was able to adjust to the gradually drying climate of much of Australia up to the present time.",2020,2020-05-05 05:20:03,2020-07-01 02:35:06,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/BT19073,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/MDZXCJHN/Dörken et al. - 2020 - Anatomical aspects of xeromorphy in arid-adapted p.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1071/BT19073,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Processing of seeds by leaching in soil or water enables detoxification and preservation of the pre-colonial staple, a Nyungar technique archaeologically dated to at least 13 000 years BP. We measured the distance of M. dyeri populations to cultural landscape features and registered heritage sites. We also compared within-population plant distribution characteristics to Nyungar occupation preferences around granite inselbergs. We found evidence of Nyungar influence on contemporary distribution of M. dyeri. Populations of M. dyeri occur close to surface water features in the west and granite outcrops in the east of Nyungar country, which corresponds closely to differential pre-colonial patterns of Nyungar occupation. M. dyeri population frequency was negatively correlated with distance to registered Nyungar sites, and 75% of all M. dyeri populations occur within 3.2 km of a registered Nyungar site. We found no correlation between habitat availability and size of granite populations, but found that Nyungar occupation preferences in relation to ground surface aspect, slope and landform type correlated with intra-population M. dyeri plant distribution, suggesting a mutualistic relationship with Nyungar people, has influenced the plant’s distribution. We suggest that contemporary M. dyeri distribution is therefore useful for interpreting past location-specific Nyungar land practices to inform contemporary conservation management. Our findings demonstrate that along with edaphic, climate and other environmental factors, consideration of pre-colonial human dispersal and land practices is important for plant conservation in Australia, particularly for taxa with prolonged use by humans. Further, we suggest that analyses of long-lived Macrozamia elsewhere may be useful for interpreting past Aboriginal land practices.",2020,2020-06-02 06:25:08,2020-07-01 02:29:30,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/aec.12907,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/3NY5QMBJ/Lullfitz et al. - 2020 - Contemporary distribution of Macrozamia dyeri (Zam.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1111/aec.12907,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1442-9985,1442-9993",1442-9985,Austral Ecology,Wiley,2020-05-23,2020,Contemporary distribution of Macrozamia dyeri (Zamiaceae) is correlated with patterns of Nyungar occupation in south‐east coastal Western Australia,2021-12-03T16:48:01.941829,

While sociality in some invertebrates, birds and mammals is relatively well understood, complex social behaviour in Squamate reptiles is a comparatively recent discovery. The extent to which social behaviour is phylogenetically constrained, or free to respond to environmental conditions is a key question in understanding sociality. We sampled 74 aggregations involving 137 individuals of a social lizard (Egernia stokesii) from 13 sites across a 96 250 km2 area showing a wide range of environmental conditions. Over all locations, 70% of the lizards were found in aggregations, supporting the previous suggestion that aggregation in this species is phylogenetically constrained. However, the size of aggregations was negatively related to spatial variation in aridity and daily variation in maximum temperature, suggesting that social behaviour also varied in response to harsh environmental conditions. Lizards aggregated more in arid areas and on cold days. Our results show that it is overly simplistic to regard social behaviour in E. stokesii as either phylogenetically constrained or environmentally determined.

In this study, we explore what hampers dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a field that produces a large amount of heterogeneous data. We analyze the primary source in dataset search - metadata - and determine if they reflect scholarly search interests. We examine if metadata standards provide elements corresponding to search interests, we inspect if selected data repositories use metadata standards representing scholarly interests, and we determine how many fields of the metadata standards used are filled. To determine search interests in biodiversity research, we gathered 169 questions that researchers aimed to answer with the help of retrieved data, identified biological entities and grouped them into 13 categories. Our findings indicate that environments, materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations, data parameters and data types are important search interests in biodiversity research. The comparison with existing metadata standards shows that domain-specific standards cover search interests quite well, whereas general standards do not explicitly contain elements that reflect search interests. We inspect metadata from five large data repositories. Our results confirm that metadata currently poorly reflect search interests in biodiversity research. From these findings, we derive recommendations for researchers and data repositories how to bridge the gap between search interest and metadata provided.",2020,2020-03-10 03:57:51,2020-07-01 02:14:51,2020-03-10 03:57:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GS 2020,,-,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/GPXBEQD8/Löffler et al. - 2020 - Dataset Search In Biodiversity Research Do Metada.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

We present Deep SESR, a residual-in-residual network-based generative model that can learn to restore perceptual image qualities at 2x, 3x, or 4x higher spatial resolution. We supervise its training by formulating a multi-modal objective function that addresses the chrominance-specific underwater color degradation, lack of image sharpness, and loss in high-level feature representation. It is also supervised to learn salient foreground regions in the image, which in turn guides the network to learn global contrast enhancement. We design an end-to-end training pipeline to jointly learn the saliency prediction and SESR on a shared hierarchical feature space for fast inference. Moreover, we present UFO-120, the first dataset to facilitate large-scale SESR learning; it contains over 1500 training samples and a benchmark test set of 120 samples. By thorough experimental evaluation on the UFO-120 and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that Deep SESR outperforms the existing solutions for underwater image enhancement and super-resolution. We also validate its generalization performance on several test cases that include underwater images with diverse spectral and spatial degradation levels, and also terrestrial images with unseen natural objects. Lastly, we analyze its computational feasibility for single-board deployments and demonstrate its operational benefits for visually-guided underwater robots.

There is a specific focus on West Australian terrestrial orchids, but many of the approaches have universal relevance. Aspects of the framework include (1) setting appropriate objectives, (2) establishing effective collaborations between scientists, volunteers and regulators to fill knowledge and funding gaps, (3) use of survey and demographics data to determine extinction risks and management requirements for species, (4) effective habitat management to overcome threats such as grazing, (5) finding potential new habitats by modelling climate and site data, (6) investigating the effectiveness of pollinators and (7) using seed baiting to detect mycorrhizal fungi. The relative cost and effectiveness of different methods used to propagate orchids for translocation are compared. Methods known to be successful, in order of complexity, include placement of seed in situ, vegetative propagation, symbiotic germination in non-sterile organic matter, symbiotic germination in sterile culture, asymbiotic sterile germination and clonal division in tissue culture. These form a continuum of complexity, cost, time required, faculties needed, as well as the capacity to maintain genetic diversity and produce seedlings preadapted to survive in situ. They all start with seed collection and lead to seed storage, living collections used as tuber banks and seed orchards, as well as translocation for conservation. They could also lead to commercial availability and sustainable ecotourism, both of which are needed to reduce pressure on wild plants. Overall, there has been a strong preference to use relatively complex, expensive and time-consuming methods for orchid conservation, despite evidence that simpler approaches have also been successful. These simpler methods, which include in situ seed placement and non-sterile germination on inorganic substrates, should be trialled in combination with more complex orchid propagation methods as part of an adaptive management framework. It is essential that orchid conservation projects harness the unique biological features of orchids, such as abundant seed production and mycorrhizal fungi which are far more widespread than their hosts. This is necessary to increase the efficiency and coverage of recovery actions for the largest and most threatened plant family.",2020,2020-06-19 05:46:51,2020-07-01 01:33:45,2020-06-19 05:46:51,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ProQuest,,10.20944/preprints202004.0465.v1,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/KYNBEJ94/Brundrett - 2020 - A Proposed Framework for Efficient and Cost-Effect.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,10.20944/preprints202004.0465.v1,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,posted-content,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,MDPI AG,2020-04-26,2020,A Proposed Framework for Efficient and Cost-Effective Terrestrial Orchid Conservation,2021-01-14T07:32:01.103232,

One consequence of this new paradigm is increased uncertainty regarding biogeographic studies based on pre-molecular species records. The question “how does one delineate an individual species?” has changed and differing interpretations may alter how previous assessments are viewed. In some instances, specimens previously regarded as a single species have been shown to represent multiple genetic lineages. An extreme example is that of the red alga Portiera hornemannii, now thought to include 21 cryptic species in the Philippines alone, and possibly up to 96 species in the wider Indo-Pacific. Reworking and reclassification of species based on DNA analyses have sunk many species into one, or combined or reorganized genera.

Families Bombyliidae (bee flies) and Syrphidae (hover flies) are globally distributed with aproximately 5000 and 6200 described species, respectively. Many studies have attempted to quantify Syrphidae diversity in natural and agricultural environments, due to their perceived value as pollinators, decomposers of organic waste and agents of pest control. However, to date, there have been only two studies of Syrphidae communities in Australia, both of which focused on arable crops. Meanwhile, there have been very few studies of Bombyliidae diversity and none in Australia, despite the fact that bombyliid diversity can be high, far exceeding that of Syrphidae in some ecosystems. We aimed to learn more about Australia's anthophilous Diptera and their diversity in agricultural and native ecosystems. Using a combination of pan trapping and observation plot surveys, we assessed bombyliid and syrphid diversity at Bilpin, New South Wales, Australia, an important horticultural area within the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. Five syrphid species made up 62% of all individuals collected, while 22 species made up the remaining 32%, including nine species of Bombyliidae. The hover fly Melangyna viridiceps alone accounted for a third of all captured specimens. The larvae of the five most commonly encountered species are all aphidophagous. As such, aphidophagous species appear to be numerically dominant, and this is consistent with previous studies in south-east Australian agroecosystems. M. viridiceps and Triglyphus fulvicornis were frequent visitors to flowering fruit trees and may therefore contribute to the pollination of these crops. However, most visited flowers were introduced weeds or escaped crop plants. The maintenance of diverse floral resources, which may include weeds, is important for sustaining populations of aphidophagous Syrphidae, which may contribute to both pollination and pest control. As a consequence, we recommend a more tolerant approach to weed management in orchards to better facilitate the ecosystem services provided by Diptera.",2020,2020-06-26 04:23:56,2020-06-26 04:24:41,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/aen.12483,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/QPN4M42T/Robertson et al. - 2020 - Species diversity in bee flies and hover flies (Di.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1111/aen.12483,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"2052-174X,2052-1758",2052-174X,Austral Entomology,Wiley,2020-06-18,2020,"Species diversity in bee flies and hover flies (Diptera: Bombyliidae and Syrphidae) in the horticultural environments of the Blue Mountains, Australia",2021-01-21T05:01:42.259466,

Assumptions based on distributional, taxonomic or functional generalizations are often made when deciding how to source plant material for restoration. We investigate this assumption and ask whether species-specific data is required to optimize provenancing strategies. We use population genetic and environmental data from five congeneric and largely co-distributed species of Acacia to specifically ask how different species-specific genetic provenancing strategies are based on empirical data and how well a simple, standardized collection strategy would work when applied to the same species. We find substantial variability in terms of patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation across the landscape among these five co-distributed Acacia species.

Furthermore, when a common provenancing strategy was applied to each species, the recommended collection areas and the evolutionary representativeness of such artificially standardized areas were substantially different (smaller) from those identified based on environmental and genetic data.

Past studies often used modelling approaches to investigate the irrigation cooling effect during heatwaves. However, few observational studies have compared the differences in micro-scale irrigation cooling effect between heatwave and non-heatwave conditions. This study examines whether nocturnal irrigation cooling effects intensify during heatwaves, as there have been conflicting results in the literature regarding this issue. During the Australian summer of December 2013 to March 2014, this study was conducted in the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria’s Melbourne Gardens (mixture of Australian and exotic vegetation) and in the Australian Gardens of its Cranbourne Gardens (specialises in Australian vegetation). We used the excess heat factor (EHF) to identify one severe heatwave (EHF = 34.9) and one extreme heatwave (EHF = 155.6) in our study period. Using meteorological observations, irrigation data and one-way ANOVA, we present the differences in cooling associated with irrigation between different types of landscape in the two gardens. During non-heatwave conditions, there was 0.5 °C – 1 °C of cooling associated with overnight irrigation of 20–25 mm. During heatwave conditions, several lawn areas recorded greater cooling (2 °C – 4 °C) associated with irrigation of similar amounts, but this phenomenon was not observed in areas dominated by hard surfaces. The magnitude and timing of the irrigation cooling effects also differed in various garden sites, with residual cooling effects observed lasting for several hours in certain sites following nocturnal irrigation events. Our results suggest that some significant cooling at the micro-scale is apparent from irrigated landscape in Melbourne, which has a temperate oceanic climate with occasional heatwaves. Moreover, the irrigation cooling effect in the Melbourne Gardens intensifies during heatwaves. Our findings could inform landscape succession planning to prepare for a hotter future climate.",2020,2020-09-09 02:26:29,2020-09-10 02:59:11,,126815,,,55,,,,,,,en,,,,,Scopus,,10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126815,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/Z9JQXLH6/Lam et al. - 2020 - Does irrigation cooling effect intensify during he.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126815,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1618-8667,1610-8167,Urban Forestry & Urban Greening,Elsevier BV,2020-11-01,2020,Does irrigation cooling effect intensify during heatwaves?

Their low density and secretive habits also make it difficult to know the spatial extent, size, and connectivity of populations; declines hence can go unnoticed. Here, we quantified decline in a large marsupial carnivore, the spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus gracilis), endemic to the Wet Tropics rainforest of northeast Australia. We compiled a large database of occurrence records and used species distributional modeling to estimate the distribution in four time periods (Pre-1956, 1956–1975, 1976–1995, 1996–2016) using climate layers and three human-use variables. The most supported variables in the distribution models were climatic, with highly suitable quoll habitat having relatively high precipitation, low temperatures, and a narrow annual range in temperature. Land-use type and road density also influenced quoll distribution in some time periods. The modeling revealed a significant decline in the distribution of D. m. gracilis over the last century, with contraction away from peripheral areas and from large areas of the Atherton Tablelands in the center of the distribution. Tests of the change in patch availability for populations of 20, 50, and 100 individuals revealed a substantial (17–32%) decline in available habitat for all population sizes, with a particular decline (31–40%) in core habitat (i.e., excluding edges). Six remaining populations were defined. Extrapolating capture–recapture density estimates derived from two populations in 2017 suggests these populations are small and range from about 10 to 160 individuals. Our total population estimate sums to 424 individuals, but we outline why this estimate is positively skewed and that the actual population size may be < 300 individuals. Continued decline and apparent absence in areas of highly suitable habitat suggests some threats are not being captured in our models. From our results, we provide management and research recommendations for this enigmatic predator.",2020,2020-09-09 05:38:29,2020-09-10 02:51:56,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1093/jmammal/gyaa077,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/22YB3QFY/Uzqueda et al. - 2020 - Quantifying range decline and remaining population.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Modelling; Species occurrence records,10.1093/jmammal/gyaa077,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0022-2372,1545-1542",0022-2372,Journal of Mammalogy,Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-08-17,2020,Quantifying range decline and remaining populations of the large marsupial carnivore of Australia’s tropical rainforest,2021-08-07T15:15:10.282255,

During wet periods, these wetlands can receive large amounts of suspended and dissolved material from the catchment, including many potential pollutants. In this study, we use traditional isotope tracers (&delta;15N and &delta;13C) along with soil eDNA to investigate the sources of transported materials and potential contaminants in seven forested floodplain wetlands in tropical Australia. We hypothesised that eDNA and isotope tracers in the soil would reflect the land use of the catchment. Our goal was to test whether eDNA could be used as a potential tool to identify and monitor pollutants in floodplain wetlands. The sampling sites were located within catchments that have a mosaic of land types, from well-conserved rainforests to intensive agricultural land uses, such as grazing, sugar cane, wood production, and horticulture. The soil eDNA was comprised of a mix of plant species consistent with the land use of the catchments. Most of the eDNA pool was derived from native trees, accounting for 46.2 &plusmn; 6.5% of the total; while cultivated species associated with agricultural activities contributed to 1&ndash;24% of the total. From the cultivated species, highest contributions (&gt;5%) were from Sorghum sp. used for grazing, banana (Musa ornata), melons (Cucumis melo), and Pinus radiata and Juniperus sp. grown for wood production. Interestingly, tropical wetlands on sites 15 km offshore had soil eDNA from agricultural activities of the mainland, highlighting the connectivity of these wetlands, probably during extensive floods. Overall, soil eDNA, more than isotopic tracers, showed promising results for tracing and monitoring potential pollutants in tropical floodplain wetlands that are highly connected and susceptible to environmental degradation.",2020,2020-09-09 05:41:05,2020-09-10 02:50:17,,892,,8,11,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.3390/f11080892,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/KMWD3ZFR/Adame and Reef - 2020 - Potential Pollution Sources from Agricultural Acti.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.3390/f11080892,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1999-4907,1999-4907,Forests,MDPI AG,2020-08-17,2020,Potential Pollution Sources from Agricultural Activities on Tropical Forested Floodplain Wetlands Revealed by Soil eDNA,2021-09-29T14:27:55.888018,

It also provides insights into species' sensitivity to environmental change that are unable to be identified through analysis of declines in range size or abundance alone. Here, we apply the recently proposed 'niche reduction hypothesis' to investigate relationships between trends in niche breadth and geographic distribution of declining species. Location Northern Australia. Methods We compare and contrast contemporary and historical data sets to examine the relationship between extent of occurrence (EOO) and realized niche hypervolume, and investigate changes in species' utilization of environmental space through time via generalized linear modelling and bootstrapping of historical values. We also use the 'Maxent' algorithm to create and stack contemporary and historical ecological niche models (ENMs) and identify regions where resilience to threatening processes is maximized. Results We found larger mean reductions in niche hypervolume (39%) than EOO (30.5%), with little correlation (r = 0.07) between the two measures, suggesting that contraction of realized niche breadth can be largely independent of reduction in EOO. We also identified a general set of environmental conditions towards which species' realized niches contracted. Comparison of stacked ENMs allowed us to identify regions of natural refuge where environmental conditions are associated with increased species resilience to threats, and conversely, regions where habitat suitability has declined. Main conclusions Examining species declines from an ecological niche perspective provides a powerful tool for understanding how environmental conditions, biotic interactions and species traits shape responses to local and global environmental changes. Quantifying reductions in niche breadth is crucial as contraction to a narrower subset of environmental space can reduce a species' ability to tolerate other threats and potentially lower adaptive capacity and genetic diversity, increasing extinction risk.",2020,2020-09-09 05:35:04,2020-09-10 02:47:30,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/ddi.13145,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/YW2AWWZS/von Takach et al. - 2020 - Patterns of niche contraction identify vital refug.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Modelling; Species occurrence records; ALA4R,10.1111/ddi.13145,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,"1366-9516,1472-4642",1366-9516,Diversity and Distributions,Wiley,2020-08-20,2020,Patterns of niche contraction identify vital refuge areas for declining mammals,2021-04-23T15:24:59.946335,

During the last century, the species was unintentionally introduced into coastal dune systems around the world. The purpose of this study was to explore the means of dispersal of this invasive in the newly established populations on the coastal dunes of Spain and to determine if they contribute significantly to the invasion process. After reconstructing the history of its spread in Spain from available records, we tested whether dispersion by marine currents can be a mechanism of colonization at regional scale, and whether the presence of native vertebrate participate in the expansion process at local scale. Through laboratory experiments, we demonstrated that the seeds of O. drummondii can be dispersed by seawater, since 0.63% present both buoyancy in seawater and subsequent germination after being washed with fresh water. This capacity for dispersal by marine currents could explain both the expansion of the species along the southwestern coast of Spain and the maintenance of its populations following disturbances such as storms. We also demonstrated that Iberian Hares and European Rabbits can disperse the seeds by endozoochory; seeds recovered from faecal pellets of these species were capable of germination (73 and 63%, respectively). Oenothera drummondii has become an invader only in coastal dunes where these dispersers are present, and with no control actions to regulate their populations. In conclusion, O. drummondii is an alien species with varying dispersal methods, polychory. This helps maintain already established populations and disperses seeds at a regional level, depending on the incidence of storms and the presence or absence of rabbits and hares for efficient local seed dispersion. Thus, management actions that restrict marine and animal dispersal likely have the benefit of limiting the invasive potential of O. drummondii.",2020,2020-09-09 03:40:45,2020-09-10 02:44:32,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1007/s10530-020-02359-6,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/AG2XWNLP/Gallego-Fernández et al. - 2020 - Multiple seed dispersal modes of an invasive plant.pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

However, intraspecific phenotypic diversity is rarely assessed beyond taxonomy-focused linear measurements or qualitative descriptions. Here, we use a technique widely used in the evolutionary sciences—geometric morphometrics—to characterize shape diversity in the skull of an endangered marsupial, the northern quoll, across its 5,000 km distribution range along Northern Australia. Skull shape is a proxy for feeding, behavior, and phenotypic differentiation, allowing us to ask whether populations can be distinguished and whether patterns of variation indicate adaptability to changing environmental conditions. We analyzed skull shape in 101 individuals across four mainland populations and several islands. We assessed the contribution of population, size, sex, rainfall, temperature, and geography to skull shape variation using principal component analysis, Procrustes ANOVA, and variation partitioning analyses. The populations harbor similar amounts of broadly overlapping skull shape variation, with relatively low geographic effects. Size predicted skull shape best, coinciding with braincase size variation and differences in zygomatic arches. Size-adjusted differences in populations explained less variation with far smaller effect sizes, relating to changes in the insertion areas of masticatory muscles, as well as the upper muzzle and incisor region. Climatic and geographic variables contributed little. Strikingly, the vast majority of shape variation—76%—remained unexplained. Our results suggest a uniform intraspecific scope for shape variation, possibly due to allometric constraints or phenotypic plasticity beyond the relatively strong allometric effect. The lack of local adaptation indicates that cross-breeding between populations will not reduce local morphological skull (and probably general musculoskeletal) adaptation because none exists. However, the potential for heritable morphological variation (e.g., specialization to local diets) seems exceedingly limited. We conclude that 3D geometric morphometrics can provide a comprehensive, statistically rigorous phenomic contribution to genetic-based conservation studies.",2020,2020-09-09 05:49:59,2020-09-09 05:51:05,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1002/ece3.6593,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/RP2RZW2Y/Viacava et al. - 2020 - Skull shape of a widely distributed, endangered ma.pdf",,1 - ALA used; Climate Data,10.1002/ece3.6593,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"2045-7758,2045-7758",2045-7758,Ecology and Evolution,Wiley,2020-08-18,2020,"Skull shape of a widely distributed, endangered marsupial reveals little evidence of local adaptation between fragmented populations",2021-11-05T17:49:49.984412,

One hundred and 11 specimens were collected during RV Investigator voyage IN2017_V03 in May–June 2017 using a beam trawl at lower bathyal depths (1000–2500 m). This is the first record of Melinnopsis from the eastern Australian coast. The two new species are morphologically similar, but differ by methyl blue staining pattern, shape of thoracic uncini and pigmented glandular bands above the nuchal slits. Melinnopsis gardelli sp. nov. has a conspicuous stained band on the dorsum ending between chaetigers 9 and 10, uncini with three teeth above the rostral tooth and lacks glandular bands, while M. chadwicki sp. nov. has a faint stained band on the dorsum ending at chaetiger 5, uncini with two teeth above the rostral tooth and possesses glandular bands. They also show differences in bathymetric distribution as M. gardelli sp. nov. was collected around 2500 m and M. chadwicki sp. nov. around 1000 m depth. Phylogenetic relationships among the new species and other members of the family Ampharetidae were assessed using the nuclear 18S and the mitochondrial 16S and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene fragments. The results revealed that M. gardelli sp. nov. and M. chadwicki sp. nov. form a monophyletic clade and are genetically distinct from each other and all other analysed species.

Predicting the evolutionary trajectory of species essential to ecosystem function under future climates is challenging but necessary for prioritizing conservation investments. We use a combination of population genetics and niche suitability models to assess the trajectory of a functionally important, but highly fragmented, plant species from south-eastern Australia (Banksia marginata, Proteaceae). We demonstrate significant genetic structuring among, and high level of relatedness within, fragmented remnant populations, highlighting imminent risks of inbreeding. Population simulations, controlling for effective population size (Ne), suggest that many remnant populations will suffer rapid declines in genetic diversity due to drift in the absence of intervention. Simulations were used to demonstrate how inbreeding and drift processes might be suppressed by assisted migration and population mixing approaches that enhance the size and connectivity of remnant populations. These analyses were complemented by niche suitability models that predicted substantial reductions of suitable habitat by 2080; 30% of the current distribution of the species climate niche overlaps with the projected distribution of the species climate niche in the geographic region by the 2080s. Our study highlights the importance of conserving remnant populations and establishing new populations in areas likely to support B. marginata in the future, and adopting seed sourcing strategies that can help populations overcome the risks of inbreeding and maladaptation. We also argue that ecological replacement of B. marginata using climatically suited plant species might be needed in the future to maintain ecosystem processes where B. marginata cannot persist. We recommend the need for progressive revegetation policies and practices to prevent further deterioration of species such as B. marginata and the ecosystems they support.",2020,2020-09-09 03:43:16,2020-09-09 03:44:41,,2014-2029,,8,13,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/eva.12958,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/SI9GZDPY/Miller et al. - 2020 - Genetic data and climate niche suitability models .pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Modelling; Species occurrence records,10.1111/eva.12958,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"1752-4571,1752-4571",1752-4571,Evolutionary Applications,Wiley,2020-04-17,2020,Genetic data and climate niche suitability models highlight the vulnerability of a functionally important plant species from south‐eastern Australia,2021-11-26T10:34:26.017080,

Probing was not affected by the host type but there was a significant effect on probing due to the infection status of the psyllid. More psyllids carried out probing activities in the sieve elements when infected with CLso, and more probing activities were observed from CLso-infected psyllids by comparison to the non-infected groups. Specifically, significant increases in salivation, phloem ingestion and number of probes, before and after reaching the sieve elements, were noticed in the infected groups. Furthermore, time elapsed to reach the sieve elements was significantly shortened by 2 h in the infected group. Remaining probing activities in xylem tissues were not different between all psyllid groups.

They are sensitive to human disturbances and climate change. However, regional assessments of species composition, forest structure and soil characteristics, and knowledge of the environmental factors that contribute to regional variation in their characteristics are limited. We surveyed mangrove communities at seven island locations along 450 km of the sandy south-east Queensland coast. We found no latitudinal trends in richness of common species or their abundance, likely due to shared climatic conditions across our study range, however there was considerable variation in forest structure among and within the seven sites. Over all sites, analysis of soil characteristics identified four hydro-edaphic environmental categories differing in soil water content, dry bulk density, organic matter and porewater salinity, which also varied spatially among and within sites. There were few strong relationships among forest structure and hydro-edaphic categories, although relatively small trees and high stem densities tended to be associated with soils having high soil water content, high levels of soil organic matter and low bulk density, while forests with largest trees and lowest stem densities tended to be associated with soils with intermediate characteristics, indicative of regular inundation and drainage. The two most common species (Avicennia marina and Rhizophora stylosa) had very broad distributions over the four hydro-edaphic categories, although A. marina tended to be more strongly associated with soils with high water content where R. stylosa had a lower probability of occurrence. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza had high fidelity to locations with low porewater salinity influenced by groundwater.

However, few studies have determined whether native and non-native species co-occurring with invaders have evolved tolerance to allelopathy. In this study, we conducted germination and growth experiments to evaluate whether co-occurring native Juncus pallidus and non-native Lolium rigidum species may evolve tolerance to the allelochemicals induced by Cyanara cardunculus in Australian agricultural fields. The test species were germinated and grown in pots filled with collected invaded and uninvaded rhizosphere soil of C. cardunculus with and without activated carbon (AC). Additionally, a separate experiment was done to differentiate the direct effects of AC on the test species. The soil properties showed invaded rhizosphere soils had higher total phenolic and lower pH compared with uninvaded soils. We found significant reduction of germination percentage and seedling growth in terms of above- and belowground biomass, and maximum plant height and root length of native in the invaded rhizosphere soil of C. cardunculus, but little effect on non-native grass species. Even soil manipulated with AC showed no significant differences in the measured parameters of non-native except aboveground biomass.

We examined 23 species of Myrtaceae, belonging to 6 genera, and were able to identify 11 distinct types. The observed Myrtaceae pollen taxa can be confidently separated to genus level, apart from Euryomyrtus, which is indistinguishable from Leptospermum. Specifically, separation to species level is most achievable within the genus Melaleuca, as well as Kunzea and Calytrix, which are each represented by a single species. Conversely, Eucalyptus could only be separated into major types, while Leptospermum species could not be clearly separated, although differences in exine patterns exist.

The recent literature has focused on genomic signatures of climatic adaptation, but little is known about how plastic capacity may be influenced by biogeographic and evolutionary processes. We investigate phenotypic plasticity as a target of climatic selection, hypothesizing that lineages that evolved in warmer climates will exhibit greater plastic adaptive resilience to upper thermal stress. This was experimentally tested by comparing transcriptomic responses within and among temperate, subtropical, and desert ecotypes of Australian rainbowfish subjected to contemporary and projected summer temperatures. Critical thermal maxima were estimated, and ecological niches delineated using bioclimatic modeling. A comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model was used to assess plastic and evolved changes in gene expression. Although 82% of all expressed genes were found in the three ecotypes, they shared expression patterns in only 5 out of 236 genes that responded to the climate change experiment. A total of 532 genes showed signals of adaptive (i.e., genetic-based) plasticity due to ecotype-specific directional selection, and 23 of those responded to projected summer temperatures. Network analyses demonstrated centrality of these genes in thermal response pathways. The greatest adaptive resilience to upper thermal stress was shown by the subtropical ecotype, followed by the desert and temperate ecotypes. Our findings indicate that vulnerability to climate change will be highly influenced by biogeographic factors, emphasizing the value of integrative assessments of climatic adaptive traits for accurate estimation of population and ecosystem responses.",2020,2020-07-21 03:24:27,2020-07-21 03:26:31,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1073/pnas.1921124117,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/PQ4IV7I9/Sandoval-Castillo et al. - 2020 - Adaptation of plasticity to projected maximum temp.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records,10.1073/pnas.1921124117,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0027-8424,1091-6490",0027-8424,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2020-07-09,2020,Adaptation of plasticity to projected maximum temperatures and across climatically defined bioregions,2021-02-03T06:39:10.627462,

We measured community composition, abundance, richness and foraging attempts of insectivorous bats in the centre of dryland cotton crops using acoustic sampling. We examined how bat activity was related to woody vegetation in the surrounding landscape, prey insect abundance, distance to crop edge, size of field, proximity to waterbodies and moon illumination to better understand insectivorous bat diversity and foraging in crop interiors. We collected a total of 9467 acoustic files including 1198 foraging attempts (feeding buzzes) of at least 21 insectivorous bat species. The bat assemblage in cotton crop interiors (richness and diversity) was positively related to woody vegetation foliage cover within 5–10 km of the crop, as well as Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera abundance, but was negatively related to distance from the field edge into the crop and moon illumination. Increased feeding attempts were linked to increased Lepidoptera and Hemiptera on nights of high moon illumination (> 75 %). Bat activity and foraging was also higher during nights of increased insect abundance, particularly Lepidoptera, indicating that bats track food resources. Our results highlight the importance of managing bat roosting habitat at different landscape scales to enhance bat diversity and foraging in crop interiors and thus insect consumption. Given the high bat feeding activity on nights of high moon illumination and increased Hemiptera abundance, the timing of insecticide sprays to target pests, such as Hemipteran sucking bugs, could be scheduled on nights of low moon illumination. Such information is useful in identifying conservation priorities for the management of bats in intensively farmed agroecosystems and should facilitate habitat management by growers to maximise crop pest protection services in crop interiors.",2020,2020-07-21 02:24:20,2020-07-21 02:24:54,,107068,,,302,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107068,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/4JPFH8MD/Kolkert et al. - 2020 - Insectivorous bats foraging in cotton crop interio.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107068,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0167-8809,0167-8809,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",Elsevier BV,2020-10-01,2020,"Insectivorous bats foraging in cotton crop interiors is driven by moon illumination and insect abundance, but diversity benefits from woody vegetation cover",2021-01-18T14:43:19.474694,

Our data compilation on handfishes (Family Brachionichthyidae) revealed them as the most threatened marine bony fish family, with 7 of 14 species recently listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered. The family also includes the only exclusively marine bony fish to be recognised as Extinct – the Smooth handfish (Sympterichthys unipennis). Ironically, some of the characteristics that threaten handfishes with extinction have assisted assessments. Poor dispersal capabilities leading to small, fragmented populations allow monitoring and population size estimation for some shallow water species. Evidence that the Smooth handfish is now Extinct included no sightings over 200 years in an area subject to numerous scientific surveys, inferred shallow habitat and moderate abundance at time of original collection, and major habitat transformation through fishing, aquaculture, rising sea temperature, and urban development. Contemporary threats to extant handfish species include habitat degradation, introduced species, loss of spawning substrate, climate change, and demographic risks associated with small, fragmented populations. Multifaceted conservation efforts are needed, including addressing threats to habitat quality, bolstering wild population numbers, and implementing novel techniques to find and monitor populations. Expanded monitoring, including application of eDNA methods, represent critical steps towards overcoming the challenges in studying wild populations of rare marine species.

Site-species matching requires knowledge of the growth response of a given species to the full range of environmental conditions in potential planting sites. This can be achieved by repeatedly measuring species growth at a comprehensive network of sample plots that cover a range of environmental conditions, including topography, climate, and soil factors. The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative has established permanent sample plots (PSPs) of a plantation species, Eucalyptus bosistoana F.Muell., across New Zealand. However, these PSPs do not cover the entire range of environmental conditions available for the species and hence there is a need to expand the network of sites. The aim of this study was to determine optimal locations for new PSPs to provide more unique information to support site-species matching studies for Eucalyptus bosistoana in New Zealand. Methods: A geographic information system (GIS) and stratified random sampling method were used to generate a model to identify optimal locations for E. bosistoana PSP establishment. The variables used in this study included topography, climate, and soil data. Redundancy between the initial set of potential explanatory variables was reduced by a multi-collinearity analysis. The potential habitat for the species was restricted to land with environmental conditions that could support E. bosistoana. All environmental variables were stratified and an initial priority index for each stratum in each variable was calculated. Then a weighted-overlay analysis was conducted to create the final priority index, which was mapped to identify high-priority areas for targeted PSP expansion. Results: The existing PSP network for E. bosistoana generally covers the environmental conditions in low-elevation New Zealand dry lands, which are located alongside the east coast of the South Island, and the southern part of the North Island. The model identified high priority areas for PSP expansion, including several large regions in the North Island, especially in Rangitikei and Taupo Districts. Conclusions: The model successfully allowed identification of areas for a strategic expansion of permanent sample plots for E. bosistoana. Newly identified areas expand upon the topographic, climatic, and soil conditions represented by the existing PSP network. The new area for PSP expansion has potential to provide valuable information for further site-species matching studies.

Human-mediated habitat loss and fragmentation over the past century has caused a rapid decline in abundance and exacerbated reduced connectivity between remnant populations across three disjunct regions. To assess conservation requirements, we measured the genetic structure of 27 populations using double digest RADseq). We combined our genetic data with habitat models under projected climate scenarios to identify changes in future habitat suitability. There was evidence of regional differentiation that may pre-date (but also may be compounded) by recent habitat fragmentation. We also found significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance when comparing sites across regions. Overall, S. napiformis showed low genetic diversity and a relatively high proportion of inbreeding/selfing. Climate modelling, based on current occupancy, predicts a reduction in suitable habitat for S. napiformis under the most conservative climate change scenario. We suggest that the best conservation approach is to maximise genetic variation across the entire species range to allow dynamic evolutionary processes to proceed.

Building on an expanding field of citizen science research and practice, we present a global overview of the current extent and potential of marine citizen science and its contribution to marine conservation. Employing an online global survey, we explore the geographical distribution, type and format of 74 marine citizen science projects. By assessing how the projects adhere to the Ten Principles of Citizen Science (as defined by the European Citizen Science Association), we investigate project development, identify challenges and outline future opportunities to contribute to marine science and conservation. Synthesizing the survey results and drawing on evidence from case studies of diverse projects, we assess whether and how citizen science can lead to new scientific knowledge and enhanced environmental stewardship.

We used an economic tool, return-on-investment, to identify cost-effective measures to reduce cetacean bycatch in the trawl, net, and line fisheries of Australia. We examined 3 management actions: spatial closures, acoustic deterrents, and gear modifications. We compared an approach for which the primary goal was to reduce the cost of bycatch reduction to fisheries with an approach that aims solely to protect whale and dolphin species. Based on cost-effectiveness and at a fine spatial resolution, we identified the management strategies across Australia that most effectively abated dolphin and whale bycatch. Although trawl-net modifications were the cheapest strategy overall, there were many locations where spatial closures were the most cost-effective solution, despite their high costs to fisheries, due to their effectiveness in reducing all fisheries interactions.

However, the collection of such data is often difficult for species with poor detectability. Recently, invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) has emerged as a potentially powerful survey method to increase the detectability of terrestrial vertebrates. Parasitic invertebrates are effective samplers of some vertebrate diversity and can be used to detect and identify their host species by sequencing the DNA contained in their meals. Among taxa that can be very difficult to detect using traditional survey methods are many frog species, which are often of a high conservation priority. However, the potential for frog-specific iDNA surveys has not been explored; most iDNA surveys have targeted mammals. We carried out traditional audio-visual and iDNA frog surveys in eastern Australia to determine whether frog-biting midges (Corethrella and Sycorax spp.) can be used as an effective survey method for frogs. The frog species detected through each method differed. Five species were detected only during traditional surveys, three by both methods, and one exclusively via iDNA. We demonstrate for the first time that iDNA can be used in targeted surveys of frog diversity and that it may increase the detectability of some species compared to traditional surveys. iDNA holds particular promise in the search for rare species, including those that are missing, feared extinct, and may also be useful in biosecurity, detecting invasive species.",2020,2020-03-02 00:25:48,2020-11-05 05:47:14,,e00978,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00978,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/9V2A6HYJ/Cutajar and Rowley - 2020 - Surveying frogs from the bellies of their parasite.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species lists,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00978,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,2351-9894,2351-9894,Global Ecology and Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-06-01,2020,Surveying frogs from the bellies of their parasites: Invertebrate-derived DNA as a novel survey method for frogs,2021-01-15T10:01:42.759095,

Our results show that it is possible to morphologically distinguish between diurnal and low-light adapted bees, and that there is a spectrum of characters that are associated with low light conditions. We use GIS to show that low-light adapted species occur mostly in the tropics, but that some species have subtropical, arid and even temperate distributions.

Identifying the genetic mechanism(s) underpinning resistance can facilitate development of genetic markers, which can be used in monitoring programs. Moreover, understanding of genetic mechanisms in a broader population genetic context can be used to infer the origins of resistance, predict the dynamics of resistance evolution and evaluate the efficacy of different management strategies. Transitioning genetic information successfully into practical solutions requires overcoming two major hurdles. Firstly, genetic mechanisms must be identified to develop genetic markers. Secondly, routine use of genetic markers is required to build substantial spatio-temporal data on the distribution and frequency of resistance alleles. In this study, we demonstrate large knowledge gaps on the genetic mechanisms of insecticide resistances in Australia using eight established arthropod pests important to the grains industry: Bemisia tabaci (silverleaf whitefly), Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips), Halotydeus destructor (redlegged earth mite), Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm), Myzus persicae (green peach aphid), Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth), Tetranychus urticae (two-spotted spider mite) and Thrips tabaci (onion thrips). Many resistances have not been characterised at the genetic level in most pests, even for chemical MoA groups with a long history of use in Australia. Moreover, monitoring of resistance is spatio-temporally patchy, which precludes examination of long-term trends or predictive modelling. We suggest that leveraging cumulative global knowledge of resistances to develop a priori candidate genes, and incorporation of genomic approaches, can help overcome the hurdles of embracing genetic information in resistance management. We highlight the recently invasive Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) as a case study where genetic markers and genomic approaches should prove useful in rapidly assessing the risk of this species to the Australian grains industry and other agricultural commodities. The uptake of genetic information into management can only occur once its benefit to empower insecticide resistance research is fully realised. Ultimately, the road ahead requires amalgamation of multifaceted data (genes, environment and spatio-temporal replication) to better understand and predict the dynamics of resistance evolution.",2020,2020-12-15 03:17:32,2020-12-15 03:18:15,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/aen.12512,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/VXEA2E93/Thia et al. - 2020 - Empowering Australian insecticide resistance resea.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1111/aen.12512,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"2052-174X,2052-1758",2052-174X,Austral Entomology,Wiley,2020-12-09,2020,Empowering Australian insecticide resistance research with genetic information: the road ahead,2021-02-01T21:03:28.915641,

We investigate patterns of diversification in Scleria, and whether they are coupled with colonization events, climate niche shifts or both. Location Tropics and subtropics. Taxon Nutrushes Scleria (Cyperaceae). Methods We used molecular data from three DNA regions sequenced for 278 accessions representing 140 Scleria taxa (53% of species) to develop a chronogram, model ancestral ranges and measure rates of diversification. Integrating data from 12,978 digitized and georeferenced herbarium records, we investigated niche evolution. Results High dispersal rates in Scleria, a genus with multiple dispersal syndromes, make reconstruction of ancestral ranges at deep nodes in the phylogeny highly equivocal. Main dispersal and colonization events involve movements from South to Central America (c. 19), from Africa to Madagascar (c. 12), from Asia to Oceania (c. 7), from Africa to South America (c. 7) and Central America to South America (c. 6). The two main shifts in diversification rates happened during the warm period of the Miocene. Main conclusions Dispersification from South America to Africa without climate niche shift seems to explain the diversification shift in section Hypoporum implying that species were exapted. Shifts in climate niche evolution predate the second shift in diversification rates suggesting lineages were exapted prior to biogeographical movements.

Nevertheless, decadal- to centennial-scale EASM variability over the last two millennia is still poorly understood. Pollen-based quantitative annual precipitation (PqPann) and annual precipitation reconstructed by artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the period 650–1940 CE were reconstructed from a paleo-reservoir in South Korea. ANNs reconstruction was performed to compensate for a hiatus section. On a decadal timescale, 10 high-precipitation periods were identified, and PqPann and ANNs reconstructions were comparable to local instrumental rainfall and historic drought records.

Two specimens are recorded from the Poole Creek palaeochannel; a mid-Miocene or middle Eocene age is possible for this site, but the older age (middle Eocene) is considered more likely. These specimens represent partial endocarps, one documenting the wall thickness and internal structures of the endocarp, and the other documenting the morphology and dimensions of the endocarp surface pits. The combination of characters shown by these fossils is unique among extant and fossil Icacinaceae genera, warranting the recognition of a new genus, Manchesteria gen. nov.

Such disjunct taxa can provide insight into evolutionary processes that connect populations or drive divergence. The lichenized fungus Pseudocyphellaria glabra, for example, has a disjunct distribution—separated by the Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean—yet whether these locations should be genetically distinct is unclear. The large distances between continents may be expected to prohibit gene flow, but strong and sustained winds in the Southern Hemisphere and the small size of P. glabra propagules may facilitate migration. We compared support for these two hypotheses. Location Southeastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and Southern Chile. Taxon Pseudocyphellaria glabra (Hook. f. & Taylor) C.W. Dodge, 1948 (Ascomycota, Peltigeraceae) Methods We collected 371 samples across the disjunct range of P. glabra. We generated genomic data using restriction site‐associated DNA sequencing and reconstructed a Maximum Likelihood phylogeny using 29,098 unlinked SNPs. We then conducted population genomic analyses using 3,756 SNPs including a minimum‐spanning network, principal components analysis, discriminate analysis of principal components, and k‐means clustering. Results Maximum likelihood analysis recovered multiple well‐supported clades that roughly corresponded to geography. Population genomic analyses identified genetic structuring that generally corresponded with geographic distance; however, some individuals from Chile and Australia were assigned to genetic clusters found in New Zealand, suggesting that recent dispersal events from New Zealand have successfully colonized Chile and Australia. Main conclusion Populations of P. glabra from Australia, Chile and New Zealand are genetically distinct, but frequent long‐distance dispersal during the Quaternary probably prevented speciation. This study demonstrates the power of restriction‐site associated DNA sequencing for discernment between divergent and connective evolutionary forces that simultaneously influence the population structure of species with disjunct ranges in the Southern Ocean landmasses.",2020,2020-12-21 05:56:34,2020-12-21 05:56:34,,jbi.13983,,,,,,,,,,en,,,e717636c-6d57-370b-be3e-87475b5ec672,,Script,,10.1111/jbi.13983,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/XJNDWMES/Widhelm et al. - 2020 - Using RADseq to understand the circum‐Antarctic di.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jbi.13983,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0305-0270,1365-2699",0305-0270,Journal of Biogeography,Wiley,2020-10-06,2020,"Using RADseq to understand the circum‐Antarctic distribution of a lichenized fungus, Pseudocyphellaria glabra",2021-12-03T16:48:43.885971,

We find that a total of 44.3% of the records are potentially problematic, with large variation across taxonomic groups (25–90%). A small fraction of records was identified as erroneous in the strict sense (4.2%), and a much larger proportion as unfit for most downstream analyses (41.7%). Filters of duplicated information, collection year, and basis of record, as well as coordinates in urban areas, or for terrestrial taxa in the sea or marine taxa on land, have the greatest effect.

Nevertheless, we still lack an adequate understanding of HPAI H5N1 epidemiology and infection ecology. The nature of the wild waterfowl-poultry interface, and the sharing of diverse wetland habitat among these birds, currently underscore important knowledge gaps. India has emerged as a global hotspot for HPAI H5N1, while also providing critical wintering habitat for many species of migratory waterfowl and year-round habitat for several resident waterfowl species. The current study sought to examine the extent to which the wild waterfowl-poultry interface, varied wetland habitat, and climate influence HPAI H5N1 epizootics in poultry in India. Using World Organisation for Animal Health reported outbreaks, this study showed that the wild waterfowl-poultry interface and lacustrine, riparian, and coastal marsh wetland systems were strongly associated with landscape suitability, and these realtionships varied by scale. Although increasing poultry density was associated with increasing risk, this was only the case in the absence of wild waterfowl habitat, and only at local scale. In landscapes increasingly shared between wild waterfowl and poultry, suitability was greater among lower density poultry, again at local scale only. These findings provide further insight into the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in India and suggest important landscape targets for blocking the waterfowl-poultry interface to interrupt virus transmission and prevent future outbreaks.",2020,2020-12-21 05:56:34,2020-12-21 05:56:34,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,1264ca62-fda3-37b8-b01b-d9bf9b22ad64,,Script,,10.1101/2020.09.23.310888v1,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/IXPTZAYV/Walsh et al. - 2020 - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) landscape.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1101/2020.09.23.310888,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,posted-content,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,2020-09-25,2020,Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) landscape suitability varies by wetland habitats and the degree of interface between wild waterfowl and poultry in India,2021-02-08T17:50:01.178067,

While estimating future climate‐induced changes in fish distribution is an important contribution to sustainable resource management, the impacts on European small pelagic fish—representing over 50% of the landings in the Mediterranean and Black Sea between 2000 and 2013—are yet largely understudied. Here, we investigated potential changes in the spatial distribution of seven of the most harvested small pelagic fish species in Europe under several climate change scenarios over the 21st century. For each species, we considered eight Species Distribution Models (SDMs), five General Circulation Models (GCMs) and three emission scenarios (the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways; RCPs). Under all scenarios, our results revealed that the environmental suitability for most of the seven species may strongly decrease in the Mediterranean and western North Sea while increasing in the Black and Baltic Seas. This potential northward range expansion of species is supported by a strong convergence among projections and a low variability between RCPs. Under the most pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5), climate‐related local extinctions were expected in the south‐eastern Mediterranean basin.

Without biologically informed baseline assumptions, complex default SDM models could be selected, even though alternative settings may be more appropriate. Here we explored the effects of various SDM design strategies on distribution mapping of four forest invasive species (FIS) in Canada. We found that if we ignored the underlying FIS biology such as use of biologically relevant predictors, appropriate feature selection and inclusion of dispersal and biotic interactions when we developed our SDMs, we obtained complex SDMs (default) that provided an incomplete picture of the potential FIS invasion. We recommend simplifying SDM complexity and including biologically informed assumptions to achieve more accurate dispersal predictions, particularly when projecting FIS spread across time.

In many cases, all that is known about a taxon is contained in this kind of literature, particularly for the most diverse and understudied groups. Taxonomic publications in the aggregate have documented a vast amount of specimen data. Among other things, these data constitute evidence of the existence of a particular taxon within a spatial and temporal context. When knowledge about a particular taxonomic group is rudimentary, investigators motivated to contribute new knowledge can use legacy records to guide them in their search for new specimens in the field. However, these legacy data are in the form of unstructured text, making it difficult to extract and analyze without a human interpreter. Here, we used a combination of semi-automatic tools to extract and categorize specimen data from taxonomic literature of one family of ground spiders (Liocranidae). We tested the application of these data on fieldwork optimization, using the relative abundance of adult specimens reported in literature as a proxy to find the best times and places for collecting the species (Teutamus politus) and its relatives (Teutamus group, TG) within Southeast Asia. Based on these analyses we decided to collect in three provinces in Thailand during the months of June and August. With our approach, we were able to collect more specimens of T. politus (188 specimens, 95 adults) than all the previous records in literature combined (102 specimens). Our approach was also effective for sampling other representatives of the TG, yielding at least one representative of every TG genus previously reported for Thailand. In total, our samples contributed 231 specimens (134 adults) to the 351 specimens previously reported in the literature for this country. Our results exemplify one application of mined literature data that allows investigators to more efficiently allocate effort and resources for the study of neglected, endangered, or interesting taxa and geographic areas. Furthermore, the integrative workflow demonstrated here shares specimen data with global online resources like Plazi and GBIF, meaning that others can freely reuse these data and contribute to them in the future. The contributions of the present study represent an increase of more than 35% on the taxonomic coverage of the TG in GBIF based on the number of species. Also, our extracted data represents 72% of the occurrences now available through GBIF for the TG and more than 85% of occurrences of T. politus.

Ecological speciation is a process that can facilitate divergence despite gene flow due to strong selective pressures caused by ecological differences; however, the exact traits under selection are often unknown. The transition from freshwater to saltwater habitats provides strong selection targeting traits with osmoregulatory function. Several lineages of North American watersnakes (Nerodia spp.) are known to occur in saltwater habitat and represent a useful system for studying speciation by providing an opportunity to investigate gene flow and evaluate how species boundaries are maintained or degraded. We use double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing to characterize the migration-selection balance and test for evidence of ecological divergence within the Nerodia fasciata-clarkii complex in Florida. We find evidence of high intraspecific gene flow with a pattern of isolation-by-distance underlying subspecific lineages. However, we identify genetic structure indicative of reduced gene flow between inland and coastal lineages suggesting divergence due to isolation-by-environment. This pattern is consistent with observed environmental differences where the amount of admixture decreases with increased salinity. Furthermore, we identify significantly enriched terms related to osmoregulatory function among a set of candidate loci, including several genes that have been previously implicated in adaptation to salinity stress. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ecological differences, likely driven by salinity, cause strong divergent selection which promotes divergence in the N. fasciata-clarkii complex despite significant gene flow.",2020,2020-12-21 05:56:34,2020-12-21 05:56:34,,msaa266,,,,,,,,,,en,,,56424f46-8e9c-339f-aec6-8323466dde56,,Script,,10.1093/molbev/msaa266,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/VNC4QFFE/Rautsaw et al. - 2020 - Genomic Adaptations to Salinity Resist Gene Flow i.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1093/molbev/msaa266,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,1537-1719,0737-4038,Molecular Biology and Evolution,Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-10-09,2020,Genomic Adaptations to Salinity Resist Gene Flow in the Evolution of Floridian Watersnakes,2021-03-27T06:59:42.247514,

Location Europe and western Asia to 63°E. Taxon Red deer (Cervus elaphus). Methods We collected 984 records of radiocarbon‐dated red deer subfossils from the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, including 93 original dates. For each deer sample we compiled climatic and biome type data for the corresponding time intervals. Results During the last 54 ka changes in red deer range in Europe and the Urals were asynchronous and differed between western and eastern Europe and western Asia due to different environmental conditions in those regions. The range of suitable areas for deer during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was larger than previously thought and covered vast regions not only in southern but also in western and eastern Europe. Throughout the period investigated the majority of specimens inhabited forests in the temperate climatic zone. The contribution of forests in deer localities significantly decreased during the last 4 ka, due to deforestation of Europe caused by humans. Mean January temperature was the main limiting factor for species distribution. Over 90% of the samples were found in areas where mean January temperature was above −10°C.

It thus becomes critical to find out the desirable woody plant enabled for efficient biomass enzymatic saccharification. In this study, we collected total seven biomass samples from three major hardwood species showing world‐wide geographical distributions and diverse cell wall compositions. Under acid (H2SO4) and alkali (NaOH, CaO) pretreatments, all biomass samples showed remarkably enhanced enzymatic saccharification, but the P. simonii species had the highest hexoses yields from all pretreatments performed. In particular, the mild and green‐like pretreatment (10% CaO, 50°C) could lead to more than 70% cellulose degradation into fermentable hexoses in the P. simonii species, but only 24%‐38% cellulose digestions were examined in the other six samples. Importantly, the P. simonii species is of the lowest ratios of lignin S/G and hemicellulose Xyl/Ara among seven samples, being two major factors accountable for much improved lignocellulose recalcitrance. These consequently caused the most reduced cellulose DP in the pretreated P. simonii residues for enhanced biomass saccharification. Furthermore, this study performed a genome‐wide profiling of gene expression to confirm distinct wall polymer biosynthesis and biomass metabolism in the P. simonii species, consistent with its significantly improved lignocellulose recalcitrance.

However, invasive species occurrence datasets often have spatial biases that may violate key SDM assumptions. In this study, we examined alternative methods of spatial bias correction and multiple methods for model evaluation for seven invasive plant species. Location North America. Taxon Common Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), Wild Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), Leafy Spurge (Euphorbia virgata), Common Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum), Brown Knapweed (Centaurea jacea), Black Swallowwort (Vincetoxicum nigrum) and Dalmatian Toadflax (Linaria dalmatica). Methods We employed bias‐correction measures for both occurrence sampling and background sampling inputs in a factorial design for Maxent resulting in six potential models for each species. We evaluated our models for complexity, model fit and using commonly employed evaluation metrics: AUC, partial AUC, the continuous Boyce index and sensitivity. We then developed a structured process for model selection. Results Models developed without occurrence or background bias correction often were overly complex and did not transfer well to expanding range fronts. Conversely, models that employed occurrence and/or background bias‐correction measures were less complex, had better AICc scores and had greater projection into incipient areas. These simpler models were also more likely to be selected when evaluated using a process that integrated multiple evaluation metrics. We found that invasion history (e.g. established versus incipient) was associated with the effectiveness of spatial bias correction techniques. Main Conclusions While challenges exist in building climate‐based correlative species distribution models for invasive species, we found that methods relying on maximizing AUC performed poorly for invasive species.

In this study, we assessed the value of CS for termites worldwide. First, we compared the abundance and species diversity of geo-tagged termite records in iNaturalist to that of the University of Florida termite collection (UFTC) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Second, we quantified how the combination of these data sources affected the number of genera that satisfy data requirements for ecological niche modeling. Third, we assessed the taxonomic correctness of iNaturalist termite records in the Americas at the genus and family level through expert review based on photo identification. Results showed that iNaturalist records were less abundant than those in the UFTC and in GBIF, although they complemented the latter two in selected world regions. A combination of GBIF and the UFTC led to a significant increase in the number of termite genera satisfying the abundance criterion for niche modeling compared to either of those two sources alone, whereas adding iNaturalist observations as a third source only had a moderate effect on the number of termite genera satisfying that criterion. Although research grade observations in iNaturalist require a community-supported and agreed upon identification (ID) below the family taxonomic rank, our results indicated that iNaturalist data do not exhibit a higher taxonomic classification accuracy when they are designated research grade. This means that non-research grade observations can be used to more completely map the presence of termite locations in certain geographic locations without significantly jeopardizing data quality.

However, the biogeographic histories of these floras are still unresolved. Here, we report on endocarps and leaves of Menispermaceae from the Middle Eocene of Jianglang village, Bangor County, central Tibetan Plateau.

Traditional correlative modelling approaches use species observational data in model calibration and testing in a time‐averaged framework. This method averages environmental values through time to yield a single environmental value for each location. Although valuable for exploring distributions of species at a broad level, this averaging is one of myriad factors impacting model quality and reliability. We sought to optimize traditional correlative niche model performance in distributional ecology contexts by incorporating time specificity into the existing modelling framework. We modified the existing framework to account for temporal dynamics in species' distributions to produce more robust, temporally explicit models. Using the Wood Thrush Hylostichla mustelina as our study species, we introduce a method of (a) deriving a temporally explicit pseudo‐absence dataset using kernel density estimates to replicate relative sampling of sites through time, and (b) incorporating temporally explicit covariates in model calibration. By accounting for location, and month and year of primary data collection, the time‐specific models successfully yielded dynamic predictions reflecting known distributional shifts in Hylocichla mustelina's annual movement pattern. The modified data preparation steps that we present incorporate temporal dimensions into traditional correlational modelling approaches improving predictive capacity and overall utility of these models for highly mobile, short‐lived or behaviourally complex species. With the ability to estimate species' niches in greater detail, time‐specific models will be able to address specific concerns of species‐level management and policy development for highly mobile and/or migratory species, as well as disease vectors of public health interest.",2020,2020-12-21 05:56:34,2020-12-21 05:56:34,,2041-210X.13523,,,,,,,,,,en,,,6c8d5e77-7b7d-3f97-8a48-13e581b38b34,,Script,,10.1111/2041-210X.13523,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/V8PVQK6H/Ingenloff and Peterson - 2020 - Incorporating time into the traditional correlatio.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Here the evolution of chemical defenses in reproductive structures is examined in light of the optimal defense, apparency, and resource availability hypotheses within the genus Cornus using a phylogenetic comparative approach in relation to phenology and native habitat environmental data. Methods Individuals representing 25 Cornus species were tracked for reproductive phenology over a full growing season at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. Floral, fruit, and leaf tissue was sampled to quantify defensive chemistry as well as fruit nutritional traits relevant to bird dispersal. Native habitat environmental characteristics were estimated using locality data from digitized herbarium records coupled with global soil and climate data sets. Results The evolution of later flowering was correlated with increased floral tannins, and the evolution of later fruiting was correlated with increased total phenolics. Leaves were found to contain the highest tannin activity, while inflorescences contained the highest total flavonoids. Multiple aspects of fruit defensive chemistry were correlated with fruit nutritional traits. Floral and fruit defensive chemistry were evolutionarily correlated with aspects of native habitat temperature, precipitation, and soil characteristics. Conclusions Results provide tentative support for the apparency hypothesis with respect to both flower and fruit phenology, while relative concentrations of secondary metabolites across organs provide mixed support for the optimal defense hypothesis.

This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of F. vesiculosus phlorotannin extracts and purified fractions. Overall, the crude extract and its ethyl acetate fraction (EtOAc) showed good radical scavenging activity, particularly towards nitric oxide (NO•). Subsequent subfractions of EtOAc (F1 to F9) with different molecular weights were then shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced NO• production in macrophages, with stronger effects being observed for fractions of lower MWs. Of the three intracellular markers analyzed, inducible NO• synthase showed the highest sensitivity to almost all the phlorotannin-rich samples, followed by interleukin 1β and cyclooxygenase 2, which was only inhibited by F2. Furthermore, this subfraction inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory protein κBα, thus preventing the activation of NF-κB and blocking the inflammatory cascade at the transcriptional level. This sample was characterized by the presence of a major compound with a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 507 with a fragmentation pattern coherent with that of a phlorotannin derivative.

Short‐term surveys of these ecosystems are thus likely poor estimators of actual diversity. Here we develop a multimethod strategy to obtain a more complete understanding of plant diversity from a community in the Atacama Desert. We explicitly test environmental DNA‐based techniques (eDNA) to see if they can reveal the observed and ‘hidden' (dormant or locally rare) species. To estimate total plant diversity, we performed long‐term traditional surveys during eight consecutive years, including El Niño and La Niña events, we then analyzed eDNA from soil samples using high‐throughput sequencing. We further used soil pollen analysis and soil seed bank germination assays to identify ‘hidden' species. Each approach offers different subsets of current biodiversity at different taxonomic, spatial and temporal resolution, with a total of 92 taxa identified along the transect. Traditional field surveys identified 77 plant species over eight consecutive years. Observed community composition greatly varies interannually, with only 22 species seen every year. eDNA analysis revealed 37 taxa, eight of which were ‘hidden' in our field surveys. Soil samples contain a viable seed bank of 21 taxa. Soil pollen (27 taxa) and eDNA analysis show affinities with vegetation at the landscape scale but a weak relationship to local plot diversity. Multimethod approaches (including eDNA) in deserts are valuable tools that add to a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity in such extreme environments, where using a single method or observations over a few years is insufficient. Our results can also explain the resilience of Atacama plant communities as ‘hidden' taxa may have been active in the recent past or could even emerge in the future as accelerated global environmental change continues unabated.",2020,2020-12-21 05:56:34,2020-12-21 05:56:34,,ecog.05100,,,,,,,,,,en,,,f6f4304c-c9cb-3865-b657-a2eca6a717d0,,Script,,10.1111/ecog.05100,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/IAL4CHVC/Carrasco‐Puga et al. - 2020 - Revealing hidden plant diversity in arid environme.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/ecog.05100,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,"0906-7590,1600-0587",0906-7590,Ecography,Wiley,2020-10-11,2020,Revealing hidden plant diversity in arid environments,2021-11-04T19:18:11.015421,

The spreading of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus and Paysandisia archon across the Mediterranean basin caused enormous damages to cultivated palms, representing a paradigmatic case of uncontrolled diffusion of invasive alien pests. The infestation of natural populations of Chamaerops humilis, which has a particular conservation relevance being the only native palm species in Western Europe, by the two pests can be a serious threat. Nevertheless, no clear evaluation of this risk is available. I provided a first estimation of the potential geographic extent of this threat, comparing the specific climatic niches of the three species and identifying high-conflict areas and potential refuges for C. humilis through a spatial explicit approach based on niche modeling. I evidenced that the climatic niche of the palm is similar to those of the two pests. This produces frequent co-occurrence of host and pests causing potential high levels of pressure on palm populations. More specifically, R. ferrugineus represents a very widespread threat to palms, with conflict areas in most of the coasts and islands included in the C. humilis distribution. On the contrary, P. archon represents a threat only in the northeastern part of the palm range, and large potential refuges occur in southwestern Iberia, North Africa, and several islands. However, the threat by P. archon can be locally stronger than by R. ferrugineus.

We also assess how the naturalised flora may impact ecosystem processes differently than the native flora using functional traits related to plant resource use strategy. The 1798 species in the naturalised flora currently comprise 43.9% of the total number of vascular plant species, and add 67 plant families and 649 genera to the total vascular flora. The naturalised flora has a greater proportion of herbaceous species and annual species than the native flora, which could influence ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Naturalised trees have higher leaf nitrogen concentration for a given leaf area than native trees, which could increase rates of nutrient cycling in invaded forest ecosystems. A greater number of naturalised species are present in larger, more northerly, and more populated regions of New Zealand.

Of concern in South Africa is the spread of fleshy-fruited invasive plant species, which in many places are replacing indigenous vegetation in frequently disturbed and fragmented habitats. The availability of dispersers is among the most important factors for the successful invasion of fleshy fruited invasive plant species. Dispersers differ in their dispersal capacity, and the success of frugivore dispersed plants depends both on animal and plant traits. Here, we used the functional traits of fleshy-fruited invasive plants to test for specific associations with avian functional traits in Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forests, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. We predicted that fleshy-fruited invasive plant species that were more likely to persist in disturbed Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forests were small-seeded, open habitat species with longer fruiting period lengths. The use of multivariate analyses showed that avian seed dispersers and fleshy-fruited invasive plant species differed in the functional traits between species with each group (i.e. plants and avian dispersers) that were important for seed dispersal. For fleshy-fruited plants, morphological traits (seed size, fruit size) and phenological traits (fruiting period length) were more variable between the species. For avian species, the variation was in their morphology (body size, gape width, bill length), abundance and habitat specificity. As predicted, avian species that were potentially dispersing invasive plants were forest generalist and relatively abundant species persisting in the fragmented forest. Fleshy-fruited invasive plant species that were predicted to be effectively dispersed were small-seed, open habitat species with longer fruiting length including lantana (Lantana camara), white mulberry (Morus alba), Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) and bugweed (Solanum mauritianum).

Mechanistic competition models accurately predicted the northern range limits of our study species, outperforming competition‐free mechanistic models and matching the predictive ability of statistical niche models fit to occurrence records. Using the framework of modern coexistence theory, we found that relative nonlinearity in competitors' responses to temperature fluctuations maintains their coexistence boundary, highlighting the importance of this fluctuation‐dependent mechanism.

Datura stramonium commonly grows in cereal fields and produce TAs (e.g., hyoscyamine and scopolamine) which may accidentally contaminate cereals (and cereal-based foods) at occasionally high levels. Dietary exposure to TAs can be toxic and depending on the dose ingested can cause outcomes ranging from anticholinergic effects to acute poisoning and death. In 2019, 315 adults became ill and another five adults died in Uganda following consumption of a “Super Cereal” (a fortified blended food) that was later confirmed to be contaminated by TAs—a scenario which provoked this holistic review on TAs in foodstuffs. Thus, this article provides information on the history, development, occurrences, exposures, and human legislative and health benchmarks for TAs. It describes control strategies for reducing TA contamination of agricultural commodities and resultant health implications following consumption of TA contaminated foodstuffs.

However, user groups differ in their expectations, standards of performance, and desired outputs from research investment, and accommodating the motivations and fears of potential users from the outset may lead to higher levels of participation.

Linear regressions and model selection were then applied to the principal components to determine how career stage, employment role, and years of biotelemetry experience affected the respondent’s motivations and fears for participation. The analysis showed that across all sectors (academic, government, NGO) there was strong motivation to participate and belief that national shared biotelemetry infrastructure would facilitate bird management and conservation. However, results did show that a cross-sector cohort of the Australian ornithology community were keen and ready to progress collaborative infrastructure for tracking birds, and measures including data-sharing agreements could increase participation.

Despite the significant environmental damage caused by water buffalo, important cultural and commercial stakeholders request this species is managed rather than eradicated. However, gaps in knowledge of buffalo ecology limit effective policy and planning. Aims To better understand how buffalo, at current population densities, respond to seasonally changing resources in the two key habitat types that they occupy in northern Australian – upland eucalypt savanna and seasonally inundated floodplain. Methods Satellite telemetry was used to record the location of a single female buffalo from each of 11 independent clans every hour over a 12-month period. Generalised linear mixed modelling was used to assess the extent to which buffalo movements, activity-space and site revisitation correlated with forage quality (inferred from the normalised difference vegetation index – NDVI) and localised buffalo density. Key results As the dry season progressed, forage quantity and quality within the activity-space of buffalo clans decreased. In response, buffalo inhabiting floodplain exhibited increased rates of movement and enlarged the size of their activity-space. This resulted in low repeated visitation of foraging areas in the late dry season and NDVI remained relatively high within these areas. In comparison, buffalo in upland savanna maintained similar rates of activity and occupied the same activity-space size throughout the year. This resulted in frequent revisitation of the same areas in the late dry season and NDVI reached as low as zero in these foraging areas. Clan size and localised buffalo density had no significant effect on measured movement parameters. Conclusions Buffalo exhibited a behavioural strategy in upland savanna that resulted in acute removal of green herbaceous vegetation within a few kilometres of the clan’s permanent water source.

Woody species are inherently slow maturing, meaning that seeders are confined to infrequent fire regimes. However, for grasses, which mature faster, the relationships between persistence strategy and fire regime remain unknown. Globally, we analysed associations between fire regimes experienced by hundreds of grass species and their persistence strategy, within a phylogenetic context. We also tested whether persistence strategies are associated with morphological and physiological traits. Resprouters were associated with less frequent fire than seeders. Whilst modal fire frequencies were similar (fire return interval of 4–6 yr), seeders were restricted to regions with more frequent fire than resprouters, suggesting that greater competition with long‐lived resprouters restricts seeder recruitment and survival when fire is rare. Resprouting was associated with lower leaf N, higher C:N ratios and the presence of belowground buds, but was unrelated to photosynthetic pathway. Differences between the life histories of grasses and woody species led to a contrasting prevalence of seeders and resprouters in relation to fire frequency.

This stems from the understanding that latitude and elevation are primary drivers affecting temperature variations on Earth's surface, and, in turn, that temperature plays a critical ecological role. These spatial gradients have been primarily documented using highly dispersive surface species—butterflies, birds, and plants—whereas studies on subterranean organisms remain scattered. The orb‐web cave spiders Meta bourneti and M. menardi are ubiquitous inhabitants of European caves whose distributions stretches over a continental distance. They share a similar ecological niche, which should translate into competitive exclusion in co‐occurring areas. Therefore, it can be predicted that there should be an effective spatial segregation between the two species along broadscale spatial gradients. Using a dataset of >3,000 georeferenced records, we show that the two species are primarily segregated along the latitudinal gradient, with M. menardi progressively becoming more frequent and M. bourneti rarer from south to north. In their overlapping range (36.5–53.4° latitude), the two species are secondarily separated along an elevational gradient, with M. menardi occupying, on average, sites at higher elevations than M. bourneti. However, in the northernmost part of its range and in the absence of its competitor, M. menardi inhabits caves at lower elevations.

We achieve this by analysing the phylogenetic relationships among the Pelopidas as well as between the Pelopidas and tribe Baorini both inside and outside of Sri Lanka. We used DNA sequence data from the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) “barcode” region and two nuclear DNA regions, elongation factor 1-α (EF1-α) and wingless (Wgl) collected for Sri Lankan Pelopidas and combined with all available Pelopidas sequence data from public databases. The reconstructed phylogeny showed that P. mathias, P. agna and P. conjuncta were not monophyletic. Additionally, P. agna in Sri Lanka may now be a hybrid population that retains the P. agna morphology but possesses the mitochondrial DNA of P. mathias (termed a ‘ghost’ population). Finally, two lineages of P. conjuncta were identified in Sri Lanka, appearing more closely related to other species of Pelopidas than to each other. This study demonstrates the phylogenetic complexity within the Pelopidas and the uniqueness of the Sri Lankan Pelopidas that have not been previously appreciated.

Here we correlate changes in occupancy and mean flight date of 205 wild bee species in Belgium with temporal changes in temperature trend and interannual variation, agricultural intensification, and urbanization. Over the last 70 years, bee occupancy decreased on average by 33%, most likely because of agricultural intensification, and flight period of bees advanced on average by 4 days, most likely because of interannual temperature changes. Those responses resulted in a synergistic effect because species which increased in occupancy tend to be those that have shifted their phenologies earlier in the season. This leads to an overall advancement and shortening of the pollination season by 9 and 15 days respectively, with lower species richness and abundance compared to historical pollinator assemblages, except at the early start of the season.

When the influences of biotic factors are ignored, erroneous inferences about range and niche may be made. We aimed to integrate climate data with a unique set of available land cover and land use data for the six cold‐adapted amphibians of North America (Ambystoma macrodactylum, Anaxyrus hemiophrys, Anaxyrus boreas, Pseudacris maculata, Rana sylvatica, Rana luteiventris) to determine the relative importance of climate and non‐climate drivers through the use of ecological niche models for present‐day range estimates. We compared climate‐only, land use‐only, and combination models of climate and land use, derived from two different model selection techniques, to determine which was most likely to drive current distributions of cold‐adapted amphibian species. Land use layers included land cover type, human population, vegetation type, ecoregion, and the overall human footprint. The most supported models included both climate and land use, with climate and human footprint variables having the highest permutation importance and percent contribution. Models that incorporated climate and land use data performed best as measured with AIC and AUC, although qualitatively most underestimated the northern range edge, implying potential sampling bias or locations of reduced habitat quality for these species in the northern area of the ranges. There were small differences in overall combination models dependent on the method of model selection. The overall effect sizes of landscape factors within the combination models were small except for one landscape feature: human footprint, which incorporated multiple aspects of anthropogenic change on the landscape, including human population density, travel access, and agricultural impact. This aspect of the landscape was just as important as climate, and counter to what we expected, the association was mostly positive, with a negative response only occurring at very high levels. This highlights the importance of moving beyond climate only species range estimates as land cover, specifically human impact, may be driving the patterns of species’ ranges.",2020,2020-12-21 05:56:34,2020-12-22 03:38:13,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,a880a00d-ba99-38bf-ac48-91c3b7d72658,,Script,,10.1002/eap.2236,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/ILNNUFIY/Seaborn et al. - 2020 - Drivers of distributions and niches of North Ameri.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1002/eap.2236,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1051-0761,1939-5582",1051-0761,Ecological Applications,Wiley,2021-01-18,2021,Drivers of distributions and niches of North American cold‐adapted amphibians: evaluating both climate and land use,2021-01-22T13:55:50.968020,

This similarity raises concerns about how the invasive palm could impact the native species in the present and future.

In the areas where the two species potentially co-occur, the impact of the invasive species on the native should be influenced by the invasive species interactions with frugivores.

One such species is the Florida reef gecko (Sphaerodactylus notatus), the only gecko native to the eastern U.S., and a highly understudied species that persists in heavily fragmented habitats of only three coastal Florida counties. To assess the conservation status of this species, we conducted surveys throughout South Florida to determine potential extirpations from historic localities and to delimit S. notatus’ current distribution. We also estimated the level of threat S. notatus faces from sea level rise relative to other species by analyzing sea level risk of all herpetofauna in the U.S. We detected geckos in only 41% of sites with appropriate habitat, and in only 65% of historic localities.

Although Psilocaulon granulicaule (Haw.), Schwantes is listed as a highly invasive environmental weed species, there has been no previous research into its seed ecology. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature, light, pH, water stress, heat-shock, and salinity on the germination of P. granulicaule. In this study, four temperature regimes covering four different day and night temperature variations (17–7°C, 25–15°C, 30–25°C and 40–30°C) and two light regimes (12-h light–12-h dark, 24-h dark) were investigated. The effects of pH, water stress, heat-shock and salinity were investigated, using pH buffers, polyethylene glycol solutions, three heat shock events under four temperatures and a range of NaCl solutions. These tests were conducted under the identified optimum temperature range (25/15°C) and light regime for seed germination. The results showed that both temperature and photoperiod significantly influenced the germination rate, with 94.2% germination in the 25–15°C range under a 12-h light-12-h dark regime. Higher temperatures (30–40°C) reduced seed germination to <58% germination in both light regimes (57.5%, 12-h light-12-h dark; 54.17%, 24-h dark). The highest germination rates were observed in low pH solutions, high moisture levels, low heat-shocks and low salinity. The study showed that this species is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, light, pH, moisture, heat shock and salinity, suggesting that these factors can be used as critical indicators to guide effective management practices to address this weed problem. Given that seeds are sensitive to radiant heat, burning could be used as a tool to effectively manage this species.",2020,2020-10-27 04:50:01,2020-12-22 03:21:20,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/BT20060,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/WPTLTLY9/Ranaweera et al. - 2020 - Seed germination response of a potential rangeland.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1071/BT20060,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

There is archaeological evidence that Flinders Island at the eastern end of Bass Strait supported people until c. 4500 years ago but after that there is no evidence of human presence. Two previous pollen studies, covering the Holocene, from a swamp on the eastern side of the island were interpreted rather differently in terms of how influential humans were in their effects on the island’s vegetation. In this paper, two short pollen diagrams from very different places than the earlier studies are described. These add to the evidence of the type of vegetation on the island over the late Quaternary. One diagram covers only the last 1500 years and is from a 1-m deposit from near the highest peak on the island in the south. This shows that there has been little change over that time in the vegetation around the site and there has been no influence of fire in the area. By contrast, a thin peat deposit, overlying lake sediments containing freshwater mollusc shells and Characeae oogonia, from Killiecrankie Bay in the north of the island dated at c. 34000 14C calibrated (cal) before present (BP) shows evidence of fire. The vegetation at the time was not similar to the vegetation during the Holocene with little representation of eucalypts but prominence of shrubby species (Leptospermum, Melaleuca) and herbaceous taxa such as Restionaceae and Asteraceae, particularly the Pleistocene Asteraceae pollen type. The vegetation on the eastern Bassian isthmus at that time was likely to have had less tree cover than in the Holocene and was more heath-dominated.",2020,2020-12-15 03:16:01,2020-12-22 03:21:12,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/BT20026,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/4AG6PE9K/Ladd and Clarke - 2020 - Two short pollen records from the late Holocene an.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1071/BT20026,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

In the present work, the dioecious monocot Lomandra leucocephala ssp. robusta (Asparagaceae: Lomandroideae) was studied to understand how sexual dimorphisms can assist species conservation and inform us of a species’ potential significance in an ecosystem. Floral display was sexually dimorphic, as male inflorescences were displayed more prominently and more conspicuously in UV range. Male nectar analysed by thin-layer chromatography contained a higher glucose content than female nectar. However, both sexes contained hexose-rich nectar, a common indicator of generalist pollination, which was supported by observations of floral visitors. Floral extract comparison conducted via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that male extracts contained more compounds that potentially convey greater resistance to biotic and abiotic threats. Chemical comparison of leaves by high performance liquid chromatography with peak area ratio analysis revealed this technique could be used as a tool for gender identification of individuals during non-flowering periods. Due to the generalist pollination mechanisms of L. leucocephala ssp. robusta, may have an important role in the conservation and support of local insect populations. The presence of chemical biotic and abiotic resistance may also make L. leucocephala ssp. robusta a significant contributor to the ongoing stabilisation of the sand dunes. Conservation efforts required for L. leucocephala ssp. robusta are likely to be minimal, as pollination services are provided by a diversity of pollinating taxa, including introduced species, which will be abundant regardless of variable flowering periods. Further observational study of L. leucocephala ssp. robusta pollinators and differences in pollinator visitation behaviours between sexes is recommended to better understand efficient pollination for the species, and potentially reveal a greater extent of ecosystem benefit for this species.",2020,2020-10-18 23:31:37,2020-12-22 03:21:05,,275-287,,4,68,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/BT20006,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/RKH9UM9J/Draper et al. - 2020 - Sexual dimorphism in the dioecious monocot Lomandr.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1071/BT20006,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

In Tasmania, Australia, the introduced rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) may be widespread, but data on where they occur and the efficacy of control methods are limited. We used an occupancy modelling framework (presence–absence data) to undertake a survey of two populations of invasive rainbow lorikeets to: (i) understand their distribution across the north and south of the island, and (ii) evaluate the impact of removing birds from the southern population by quantifying occupancy before (2016) and after (2018) removal. The best model explaining occupancy in both populations included a negative relationship with distance from central urban areas. We found no change in site occupancy or detectability in the southern population after removal of 208 birds (potentially comprising >50% of their original population size). This result may be explained by one of three possibilities: (i) the population is larger than previously thought, (ii) the population recovered quickly after reduction, or (iii) removal of birds reduced population density but not area of occupancy.

However, some key methodological questions remain, such as which kinds of interactions are permitted to include in these models, how to incorporate the effects of multiple interacting species, and how to account for interactions that may have a temporal dependence. We addressed these questions in an effort to model the distribution of the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus during its fall migration (September–November) through Mexico, a region with new monitoring data and uncertain range limits even for this well‐studied insect. We estimated species richness of selected nectar plants (Asclepias spp.) and roosting trees (various highland species) for use as biotic variables in our models. To account for flowering phenology, we additionally estimated nectar plant richness of flowering species per month. We evaluated three types of models: climatic variables only (abiotic), plant richness estimates only (biotic) and combined (abiotic and biotic). We selected models with AICc and additionally determined if they performed better than random on spatially withheld data. We found that the combined models accounting for phenology performed best for all three months, and better than random for discriminatory ability but not omission rate. These combined models also produced the most ecologically realistic spatial patterns, but the modeled response for nectar plant richness matched ecological predictions for November only. These results represent the first model‐based monarch distributional estimates for the Mexican migration route and should provide foundations for future conservation work.

We reveal that reef fish diversification is strongly associated with species’ trophic identity and body size. Large-bodied herbivorous fishes outpace all other trophic groups in recent diversification rates, a pattern that is consistent through time. Additionally, we show that omnivory acts as an intermediate evolutionary step between higher and lower trophic levels, while planktivory represents a common transition destination.

The sustainable provision of such ecosystem functions and services requires diverse pollinator communities over the seasons. Despite evidence that climate warming shifts pollinator phenology, a general assessment of these shifts and their consequences on pollinator assemblages is still lacking. By analysing phenological shifts of over 2,000 species, we show that, on average, the mean flight date of European pollinators shifted to be 6 d earlier over the last 60 yr, while their flight period length decreased by 2 d. Our analysis further reveals that these shifts have probably altered the seasonal distribution of pollination function and services by decreasing the overlap among pollinators’ phenologies within European assemblages, except in the most northeastern part of Europe. Such changes are expected to decrease the functional redundancy and complementarity of pollinator assemblages and, therefore, might alter the performance of pollination function and services and their robustness to ongoing pollinator extinctions.",2020,2020-03-27 04:25:33,2021-01-24 06:14:58,,115-121,,1,4,,,,,,,en,,,d0b51068-6d76-3446-b87d-33985e0857e3,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1038/s41559-019-1062-4,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/JR2IYMZ5/Duchenne et al. - 2020 - Phenological shifts alter the seasonal structure o.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

According to the literature, over 70 million kelp rafts are afloat in the Southern Ocean at any one time. These living, floating islands can play host to a range of passenger species from both their original coastal location and those picked in the open ocean. Driven by winds, currents and storms towards the coast of the continent, these rafts are often cited as theoretical vectors for the introduction of new species into Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. We found non-native kelps, with a wide range of “hitchhiking” passenger organisms, on an Antarctic beach inside the flooded caldera of an active volcanic island. This is the first evidence of non-native species reaching the Antarctic continent alive on kelp rafts. one passenger species, the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, is found to be an invasive and ecologically harmful species in some cold-water regions, and this is its first record from Antarctica. the caldera of Deception island provides considerably milder conditions than the frigid surrounding waters and it could be an ideal location for newly introduced species to become established. These findings may help to explain many of the biogeographic patterns and connections we currently see in the Southern ocean. However, with the impacts of climate change in the region we may see an increase in the range and number of organisms capable of surviving both the long journey and becoming successfully established.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 06:14:46,,1639,,1,10,,,,,,,en,,,1c7850b8-43ab-3313-bf1c-a9d7d61d8baa,,Script,,10.1038/s41598-020-58561-y,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/PYGTIH7D/Avila et al. - 2020 - Invasive marine species discovered on non–native k.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Among these, herbivore defense has received significant attention, particularly with regards to grasses and grasslands. Grasses are well known for their high silica content, a trait which has important implications ranging from defense to global Si cycling. Here, we test the classic hypothesis that C4 grasses evolved stronger mechanical defenses than C3 grasses through increased phytolith deposition, in response to extensive ungulate herbivory (‘C4‐grazer hypothesis’). Despite mixed support, this hypothesis has received broad attention, even outside the realm of plant biology. Because C3 and C4 grasses typically dominate in different climates, with the latter more abundant in hot, dry regions, we also investigated the effects of water availability and temperature on Si deposition. We compiled a large dataset of grasses grown under controlled environmental conditions. Using phylogenetically informed generalized linear mixed models and character evolution models, we evaluated whether photosynthetic pathway or growth condition influenced Si concentration. We found that C4 grasses did not show consistently elevated Si concentrations compared with C3 grasses. High temperature treatments were associated with increased concentration, especially in taxa adapted to warm regions. Although the effect was less pronounced, reduced water treatment also promoted silica deposition, with slightly stronger response in dry habitat species. The evidence presented here rejects the ‘C4‐grazer hypothesis.’ Instead, we propose that the tendency for C4 grasses to outcompete C3 species under hot, dry conditions explains previous observations supporting this hypothesis. These finding also suggest a mechanism via which anthropogenic climate change may influence silica deposition in grasses and, by extension, alter the important ecological and geochemical processes it affects.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-24 06:14:32,,gcb.15343,,,,,,,,,,en,,,19f5af18-3494-3c36-bb30-829752b3a32c,,Script,,10.1111/gcb.15343,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/HMNE6DM8/Brightly et al. - 2020 - High silicon concentrations in grasses are linked .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/gcb.15343,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"1354-1013,1365-2486",1354-1013,Global Change Biology,Wiley,2020-10-12,2020,High silicon concentrations in grasses are linked to environmental conditions and not associated with C 4 photosynthesis,2021-12-03T16:48:30.641430,

Given mariculture's substantial contribution to global seafood production and its growing significance in recent decades, it is essential to evaluate the effects of climate change on mariculture and their socio‐economic consequences. Here, we projected climate change impacts on the marine aquaculture diversity for 85 of the currently most commonly farmed fish and invertebrate species in the world's coastal and/or open ocean areas. Results of ensemble projections from three Earth system models and three species distribution models show that climate change may lead to a substantial redistribution of mariculture species richness potential, with an average of 10%–40% decline in the number of species being potentially suitable to be farmed in tropical to subtropical regions. In contrast, mariculture species richness potential is projected to increase by about 40% at higher latitudes under the ‘no mitigation policy’ scenario (RCP 8.5) by the mid‐21st century. In Exclusive Economic Zones where mariculture is currently undertaken, we projected an average future decline of 1.3% and 5% in mariculture species richness potential under RCP 2.6 (‘strong mitigation’) and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the 2050s relative to the 2000s. Our findings highlight the opportunities and challenges for climate adaptation in the mariculture sector through the redistribution of farmed species and expansion of mariculture locations.

Such approaches can uncover trait-trait correlations through evolutionary time as well as provide evidence of the role of traits in adaptation across environmental gradients. For continuous traits, most phylogenetic comparative approaches to date employ a single trait value per species—often a mean of sampled individuals—or alternatively incorporate intraspecific variation as a distribution around such a mean. It has been known for quite some time that many of the most physiologically and ecologically important plant traits are actually highly plastic, changing dynamically across a growing season, with whole-plant development or in response to environmental conditions. Here we demonstrate one possible approach to assessing the evolution of such dynamic traits: the use of function-valued phylogenetic comparative methods. Methodology. Leaf traits were sampled across 25 taxa in the genus Cornus at six time points throughout the growing season in a common-garden context, followed by contrasting sets of alternative analyses to demonstrate the consequences of researcher decisions on study conclusions. Pivotal results. The vast majority of assessed traits exhibit substantial seasonal shifts. These shifts cause traditional macroevolutionary correlations assessed at different sampling dates to yield conflicting results. Function-valued approaches indicate that seasonal shifts in many traits are evolutionarily correlated, with implications for the origin of trait-trait trade-offs. Seasonal trait plasticity is also evolutionarily correlated with native habitat environmental gradients across Cornus. Conclusions. Because a very large number of plant functional traits are not fixed but vary dynamically over time or with environmental conditions, stronger insights into the evolution of plant functional traits can emerge when this dynamism is explicitly incorporated into phylogenetic comparative approaches. We encourage the adoption of such approaches, as well as the development of better tools for doing so.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 06:13:49,,88-102,,1,181,,,,,,,en,,,cfe56339-e06a-30c7-a35c-1751117613d1,,Script,,10.1086/706238,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/ZW8R2V4A/Mason et al. - 2020 - Learning from Dynamic Traits Seasonal Shifts Yiel.pdf; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/YI9VBHG7/Mason - Supplementary Information.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1086/706238,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1058-5893,1537-5315",1058-5893,International Journal of Plant Sciences,University of Chicago Press,2020-01-01,2020,Learning from Dynamic Traits: Seasonal Shifts Yield Insights into Ecophysiological Trade-Offs across Scales from Macroevolutionary to Intraindividual,2021-04-17T21:30:29.717246,

So, the aim of this study was to characterize the annual patterns of airborne Alnus pollen detected at three different locations of Malaga province, as well as to determine its possible origin, the pollen dispersion potential of these Alnus isolated populations, and their possible reproductive connectivity. Pollen sampling was conducted by means of three Hirst-type volumetric pollen traps. Samples were mounted and counted following the recommendations of the Spanish Aerobiology Network and the European Aeroallergen Society. The possible pollen sources were detected by means of a combination of meteorological information and backward air trajectories analysis. A high inter-annual variability in the annual pollen integrals was found in all the stations, favouring certain meteorological conditions a long-range transport and, therefore, causing the high concentrations detected in some specific days.

Complex questions demand a large sample size at both the population and genetic levels to obtain precise reconstructions. This is the case of the phylogeographic history of Cistus monspeliensis, a plant that displays low plastid (cpDNA) diversity in the Mediterranean Basin but high diversity in the Canary Islands. Here, we aimed to identify Mediterranean refugial areas and to accurately quantify inter‐island colonization events in the Canaries. Using a previous study as starting point, we increased sample size in two ways: (i) additional sampling of plastid genetic markers (from 1041 to 1899 bp); and (ii) additional sampling of populations (from 47 to 69) in long‐term persistence areas suggested by species distribution modeling (SDM). The synergy between SDM and extended population sampling helped find higher genetic diversity. Our deeper phylogeographic sampling of C. monspeliensis revealed the following: (i) potential refugia in long‐term persistence areas with high cpDNA diversity in western Europe and the Canary Islands; and (ii) a significant increase (from 7 to 12) in the number of inferred inter‐island colonization events across the archipelago. Our results stress the usefulness of SDM to identify the genetic signature associated with potential refugial areas.

However, raw distributional information comes principally in two forms: points of occurrence (specific geographical coordinates where a species has been observed), and expert‐prepared range maps. Each form has potential short‐comings: range maps tend to overestimate the true occurrence of a species, whereas occurrence points (because of their frequent non‐random spatial distribution) tend to underestimate it. Whereas previous comparisons of the two forms have focused on how they may differ when estimating species richness, less attention has been paid to the extent to which the two forms actually differ in their representation of a species’ environmental associations. We assess such differences using the globally distributed avian order Galliformes (294 species). For each species we overlaid range maps obtained from IUCN and point‐of‐occurrence data obtained from GBIF on global maps of four climate variables and elevation. Over all species, the median difference in distribution centroids was 234 km, and median values of all five environmental variables were highly correlated, although there were a few species outliers for each variable. We also acquired species’ elevational distribution mid‐points (mid‐point between minimum and maximum elevational extent) from the literature; median elevations from point occurrences and ranges were consistently lower (median −420 m) than mid‐points. We concluded that in most cases occurrence points were likely to produce better estimates of underlying environmental variables than range maps, although differences were often slight. We also concluded that elevational range mid‐points were biased high, and that elevation distributions based on either points or range maps provided better estimates.",2020,2020-05-01 06:23:23,2021-01-24 06:11:24,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,f62e625e-43f8-3867-98ed-f338ab520167,,Script,,10.1111/ecog.04871,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/2W8TMFW4/Rotenberry and Balasubramaniam - 2020 - Connecting species’ geographical distributions to .pdf; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/LP2ERYCJ/Rotenberry - Supplementary Information.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/ecog.04871,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"0906-7590,1600-0587",0906-7590,Ecography,Wiley,2020-03-23,2020,Connecting species’ geographical distributions to environmental variables: range maps versus observed points of occurrence,2021-05-15T03:14:49.755828,

Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research has traditionally focused on how experimentally controlled species richness affects net primary productivity (S → NPP) at small spatial grains. In contrast, the influence of productivity on richness (NPP → S) has been explored at many grains in naturally assembled communities. Mismatches in spatial scale between approaches have fuelled debate about the strength and direction of biodiversity–productivity relationships. Here, we examine the direction and strength of the influence of productivity on diversity (NPP → S) and the influence of diversity on productivity (S → NPP) and how these vary across spatial grains. Location Contiguous USA. Time period 1999–2015. Major taxa studied Woody species (angiosperms and gymnosperms). Methods Using data from North American forests at grains from local (672 m2) to coarse spatial units (median area = 35,677 km2), we assess relationships between diversity and productivity using structural equation and random forest models, while accounting for variation in climate, environmental heterogeneity, management and forest age. Results We show that relationships between S and NPP strengthen with spatial grain. Within each grain, S → NPP and NPP → S have similar magnitudes, meaning that processes underlying S → NPP and NPP → S either operate simultaneously or that one of them is real and the other is an artefact. At all spatial grains, S was one of the weakest predictors of forest productivity, which was largely driven by biomass, temperature and forest management and age. Main conclusions We conclude that spatial grain mediates relationships between biodiversity and productivity in real‐world ecosystems and that results supporting predictions from each approach (NPP → S and S → NPP) serve as an impetus for future studies testing underlying mechanisms.

In this study, we aimed to predict the global potential distribution of T. castaneum under the current climate and in response to climate change (2050 and 2100). In addition, we attempted to use the results for estimating damage and economic losses in the major cocoa beans-producing countries. The CLIMEX model was used to evaluate the climatic suitability of regions for T. castaneum, and the economic damage was estimated by incorporating a series of published models and published data. The results showed that the potential distribution of T. castaneum was consistent with that of cocoa beans-producing countries, and as expected, at the local-level, T. castaneum was concentrated in cocoa cultivation areas. It was estimated that up to 50% damage to cocoa beans and economic loss of 3.16 billion US dollars due to production loss could occur. This study is the first attempt to estimate the economic damage to cocoa bean production by predicting the potential distribution of T. castaneum.

The rationale of FPIR is that the slopes of Y-X1 regression along the X2 gradient are modeled using the nonlinear function (Slope = β1 + β3MX1M-1 X2N), instead of the linear function (Slope = β1 + β3X2) that regular regressions normally implement. The ranges of M and N are from -56 to 56 with 550 candidate values, respectively.

The genus consists of three species in eastern Asia, four species in eastern North America, and one species in Central America. Species of the genus are ecologically important trees in eastern North American and eastern Asian forests. The distribution of living species and a rich fossil record of the genus make it an excellent model for understanding the origin and evolution of the eastern Asian‐eastern North American floristic disjunction. However, despite the small number of species, relationships within the genus have remained unclear and have not been elucidated using a molecular approach. Here we integrate data from 48 nuclear genes, fossils, morphology, and ecological niche to resolve species relationships, elucidate its biogeographic history, and investigate the evolution of morphology and ecological niches, with the goal toward a better understanding of the well‐known EA‐ENA floristic disjunction. Results showed the Central American (CAM) N. talamancana was sister to the remaining species, which were divided among three, rapidly diversified subclades. Estimated divergence times and biogeographic history suggested Nyssa had an ancestral range in Eurasia and western North America in the late Paleocene. The rapid diversification occurred in the early Eocene, followed by multiple dispersals between and within the Erasian and North American continents. The genus experienced two major episodes of extinction in the early Oligocene and end of Neogene, respectively. The Central American N. talamancana represents a relic lineage of the boreotropical flora in the Paleocene/Eocene boundary that once diversified in western North America. The results supported the importance of both the North Atlantic land bridge and the Bering land bridge (BLB) for the Paleogene dispersals of Nyssa and the BLB for the Neogene dispersals and the role of Central America as refugia of the Paleogene flora. The total‐evidence based dated phylogeny suggested that the pattern of macroevolution of Nyssa coincided with paleoclimatic changes. We found a number of evolutionary changes in morphology (including wood anatomy and leaf traits) and ecological niches (precipitation and temperature) between the EA‐ENA disjunct, supporting ecological selection driving trait evolutions following geographic isolation. We also demonstrated challenges in phylogenomic studies of lineages with rapid diversification histories. The concatenation of gene data can lead to inference of strongly supported relationships incongruent with the species tree. However, conflicts in gene genealogies did not seem to impose a strong effect on divergence time dating in our case. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rapid diversification events may not be recovered in divergence time dating analysis using BEAST if critical fossil constraints of the relevant nodes are not available. Our study provides an example of complex bi‐directional exchanges of plants between Eurasia and North America in the Paleogene but “out of Asia” migrations in the Neogene to explain the present disjunct distribution of Nyssa in EA and ENA.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 06:07:18,,jse.12599,,,,,,,,,,en,,,17fc31ad-110e-3959-9322-1109ebff2166,,Script,,10.1111/jse.12599,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/LECBM5FN/Zhou et al. - 2020 - Phylogenomics, biogeography, and evolution of morp.pdf",,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jse.12599,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1674-4918,1759-6831",1759-6831,Journal of Systematics and Evolution,Wiley,2020-06-22,2020,"Phylogenomics, biogeography, and evolution of morphology and ecological niche of the eastern Asian–eastern North American Nyssa (Nyssaceae)",2021-12-03T16:48:34.618714,

For 190 Poaceae species in subtropical China, we compiled data on flowering onset and reproductive period, functional type (photosynthetic pathway and life history), and 18 climatic variables across the species’ global distributions and used phylogenetic models to determine associations. We found strong phylogenetic signals in flowering onset but not in reproductive period. Photosynthetic pathway and life history have significant interactive effects on both flowering onset and reproductive period, such that C3 annual grasses flowered the earliest and had the longest reproductive period. We found that species with wider climatic niches would flower earlier and have longer reproductive periods. Specifically, species that experience wider ranges of mean annual precipitation and coldest-month temperatures would flower earlier, and species with higher mean annual temperature and wider ranges of wettest-quarter precipitation have a longer reproductive period.

The paper argues that biodiversity is not a free good and must be paid for. Ways forward in debates on commercial research and development in Antarctica can be found through increasing attention to the valuation of ecosystem services, new approaches to natural capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services that would bring the Antarctic, and the Antarctic Treaty System, into the wider fold of work on the economics of biodiversity. Economics based approaches can be criticised for reducing biodiversity to monetary exchange values at the expense of recognition of the wider values of biodiversity and its services.

Gossypianthus is closely related to a Gomphrena radiata–G. umbellata–G. tomentosa clade and G. meyeniana, whereas Lithophila and Philoxerus appear as successive sisters of the Australian species of Gomphrena. The majority of Andean species appears in a large clade including annual and perennial species. The Cerrado species Gomphrena mollis and G. rupestris, which are C3, constitute an early-branching lineage, whereas the core Gomphrena clade is C4 and has the inner two sepals strongly compressed as synapomorphy. A major subclade evolved inflorescences with subglobose paracladia in a whorl, supported by pseudanthial leaves. Whereas the core Gomphrena clade started to diversify around 11.4 Ma (8.45–14.5 95% highest posterior density [HPD]) the Australian lineage split at only 4.8 Ma (2.61–7.18 HPD). Our detailed phylogenetic analysis of Gomphrena depicts 10 major lineages including segregate genera. We hypothesize that an adaptation to costal habitats was followed by long-distance dispersal to Australia. We also propose a revised genus concept of Gomphrena including Gossypianthus, Lithophila and Philoxerus, considering that these small segregate genera were based on states of vegetative characters exhibiting adaptations to specific habitats rather than phylogeny and overall morphology.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-24 05:58:40,,345,,3,50,,,,,,,,,,ce7f872b-bc8e-34b0-80ad-6befed90e7ee,,Script,,10.3372/wi.50.50301,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/3FRQTUKX/Limarino and Borsch - 2020 - Gomphrena (Amaranthaceae, Gomphrenoideae) diversif.pdf",,ALA GBIF DOI,10.3372/wi.50.50301,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0511-9618,0511-9618,Willdenowia,"Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin, Freie Universitaet Berlin",2020-08-31,2020,"Gomphrena (Amaranthaceae, Gomphrenoideae) diversified as a C4 lineage in the New World tropics with specializations in floral and inflorescence morphology, and an escape to Australia",2021-03-14T06:05:38.933172,

We describe a new multi-species spatial modeling platform that integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when invasive insect species could potentially invade the conterminous United States. The Degree-Days, Risk, and Phenological event mapping (DDRP) platform serves as an open-source and relatively easy-to-parameterize decision support tool to help detect new invasive threats, schedule monitoring and management actions, optimize biological control, and predict potential impacts on agricultural production. DDRP uses a process-based modeling approach in which degree-days and temperature stress are calculated daily and accumulate over time to model phenology and climatic suitability, respectively. Products include predictions of the number of completed generations, life stages present, dates of phenological events, and climatically suitable areas based on two levels of climate stress. Species parameters can be derived from laboratory and field studies, and from published and newly fitted CLIMEX models. DDRP is written entirely in R, making it flexible and extensible, and capitalizes on multiple R packages to generate gridded and graphical outputs. We illustrate the DDRP modeling platform and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species as example threats to United States agriculture: the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana, and the small tomato borer, Neoleucinodes elegantalis. We then discuss example applications of DDRP as a decision support tool, review its potential limitations and sources of model error, and outline some ideas for future improvements to the platform.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 05:56:49,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,4f3ece8c-6ba6-3a7b-9034-32a3ed70804f,,Script,,10.1101/2020.05.18.102681,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/FJII5TIM/Barker et al. - 2020 - DDRP real-time phenology and climatic suitability.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1101/2020.05.18.102681,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,posted-content,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,2020-05-21,2020,DDRP: real-time phenology and climatic suitability modeling of invasive insects,2021-12-11T14:11:58.294808,

Given that species ranges are closely allied to physiological thermal tolerances in marine organisms [2], it may therefore be expected that ocean warming would lead to abundance increases at poleward side of ranges and abundance declines toward the equator [3]. Here, we report a global analysis of abundance trends of 304 widely distributed marine species over the last century, across a range of taxonomic groups from phytoplankton to fish and marine mammals. Specifically, using a literature database, we investigate the extent that the direction and strength of long-term species abundance changes depend on the sampled location within the latitudinal range of species. Our results show that abundance increases have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the poleward side of species ranges, and abundance declines have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the equatorward side of species ranges. These data provide evidence of omnipresent large-scale changes in abundance of marine species consistent with warming over the last century and suggest that adaptation has not provided a buffer against the negative effects of warmer conditions at the equatorward extent of species ranges. On the basis of these results, we suggest that projected sea temperature increases of up to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels by 2050 [4] will continue to drive latitudinal abundance shifts in marine species, including those of importance for coastal livelihoods.",2020,2020-05-01 06:26:54,2021-01-24 05:54:23,,1572-1577.e2,,8,30,,,,,,,en,,,b6f58e09-4bcd-376c-89eb-caa0edd8fe5b,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.043,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/MA2RXYYN/Hastings et al. - 2020 - Climate Change Drives Poleward Increases and Equat.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.043,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0960-9822,0960-9822,Current Biology,Elsevier BV,2020-04-01,2020,Climate Change Drives Poleward Increases and Equatorward Declines in Marine Species,2021-12-15T21:31:25.995233,

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution; habitat; communities; responses to biotic factors; responses to environment; structure and physiology; phenology; floral and seed characters; herbivores and disease; history; and conservation. Quercus rubra is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. In its native range this species is one of the most important mid‐successional tree species. Since the 18th century Q. rubra has been introduced into forest management in Europe and elsewhere. Currently, Q. rubra is a naturalized species in 23 countries. It is an important source of wood, and this was one of the most important reasons for its introduction in forests. In forest management this species is valued for its high growth rate and drought resistance. Red Oak is also widely cultivated in Europe for its ornamental value—red leaves in autumn and smooth, grey bark. Red Oak is a threat to native species within its introduced range as it can alter environmental conditions beneath its canopy, especially by decreasing light availability and litter decomposition rate. Such conditions also contribute to biotic homogenization of the understorey vegetation. Q. rubra is widely dispersed by small mammals and birds, up to 1,500 m from seed sources, thereby increasing its potential invasiveness. In Europe Q. rubra seems to be less prone to herbivores and fungi, in contrast to its native range, where it is grazed by ungulates and insects, and infected by Phytophthora and oak wilt. Due to its higher tolerance to drought than native European oaks, Q. rubra is claimed to be one of the species replacing native trees which are decreasing due to climate warming. However, consideration of all possible consequences is needed in wide‐scale introduction of alien species, such as Q. rubra , due to negative impacts on native ecosystems.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 05:54:10,,1199-1225,,3,108,,,,,,,en,,,5ad504e8-422f-3f42-af2c-b2689a0965ca,,Script,,10.1111/1365-2745.13375,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/6VP6R262/Dyderski et al. - 2020 - Biological Flora of the British Isles Quercus rub.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

We recorded two bulb diameter optima and observed that as bulb size increases taxa inhabit warmer areas with less temperature seasonality.

Clematis sect. Fruticella s. str. is a small group of shrubby, yellow-flowered species distributed mainly in arid and semi-arid areas of China. Plants in this section are both horticulturally and ecologically important. Methods Using past, present, and future environmental variables and data with Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modeling, we evaluated the importance of the environmental variables on the section’s estimated distributions, thus simulating its distributional dynamics over time. The contractions and expansions of suitable habitat between the past and future scenarios and the present were then compared. Results and Discussion The models revealed that the areas with high and moderate suitability currently encompass about 725,110 km2. The distribution centroid location varies between points in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia during the different scenarios. Elevation, Mean UV-B of Lowest Month, Precipitation of Coldest Quarter, and Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter were major factors determining the section’s distribution. Our modeling indicated that Clematis sect. Fruticella underwent a significant range contraction during the last interglacial period, and then expanded during the last glacial maximum (LGM) to amounts like those of the present. Cold, dry, and relatively stable climate, as well as steppe or desert steppe environments may have facilitated range expansion of this cold-adapted, drought-resistant plant taxon during the LGM. Predicted future scenarios show little change in the amounts of suitable habitat for Clematis sect. Fruticella. This study aids understanding of the distributional dynamics of Clematis sect.

Models integrated 3 vertical depth layers and considered 2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) and 2 periods (2041-2050 and 2091-2100) to simulate potential future species distributions. Results predicted potentially suitable future ranges for 163 species as well as future arrivals of non-indigenous southern species. We aggregated these results to map changes in species assemblages. Results revealed that coastal areas would undergo the highest species loss among the Bay of Biscay species, depending on their vertical habitat (benthic, demersal, benthopelagic or pelagic). Benthic and demersal species were projected to experience a westward shift, which would induce a deepening of those species. In contrast, pelagic species were projected to shift northward. The potential ecological niche for half of the studied species, mostly benthic and demersal, was projected to decrease under climate change. In addition, a high rate of southern species arrivals is expected (+28%). Assessment of community composition showed high species replacement within the 0-50 m isobath, driven by the replacement of native species by southern ones.

Our goals were to investigate (1) the association between habitat suitability of fountain grass (Cenchrus setaceus), human footprint, and environmental variables; (2) the biogeographical distribution of habitat suitability of fountain grass, an aggressive invasive species that has altered native ecosystems across multiple continents; (3) what kind of habitats are most likely to be invaded by fountain grass; and (4) the potential impact of climate change on the range of fountain grass. We showed that areas with the highest suitability are in desertic and xeric areas of the Mediterranean, and dry tropical, and subtropical bioclimates. The global biogeographic pattern of the suitability of fountain grass generally increases from the equator toward subtropical areas and then decreases at the north and south portions of the globe. Areas with the highest suitability occur along broad ecotonal zones between deserts and Mediterranean regions. Models indicated human footprint and annual mean temperature most contributed to explaining the global suitability patterns of fountain grass. Climate change analysis showed a high potential contraction of the potential range of fountain grass in the Mediterranean and tropical areas of the southwest USA, northern Mexico, northeast Brazil, and South Africa. Results also indicated a potential moderate expansion of its range, mainly in tropical areas of the southwest USA and East Africa.

Location North America. Taxon Sceloporus lizards. Methods We used extant and fossil occurrence data, general circulation models of palaeoclimate, climate envelope modelling and phylogenetic comparative methods to reconstruct past suitable climates for Sceloporus lizards over the last 20 million years, and then visualized the geographical locations of individual lineages using multivariate environmental similarity surfaces (MESS) maps. Results We were able to reconstruct ancestral suitable climate for Sceloporus lineages with sufficient resolution to identify shifts in geographical location between lineages. We found that large shifts in climate regimes drove the expansion and contraction of suitable habitat through time. We found a positive association between tectonic events, like mountain uplift, and lineage diversification in the Sceloporus clade. Mountain uplift also facilitated the emergence of open grassland habitat, which excluded many Sceloporus species.

This biological evidence is further compared with cultural evidence (coins, pottery, ancient texts) and the present distribution of Phoenix spp. in the area. Bayesian methods working with likelihood and conditional probabilities are successfully applied to generate a model for displaying in maps the ancient distribution of palm groves in terms of probabilities. The model suggests that the domestication of Phoenix dactylifera occurred mainly east of 30°E, probably in the Jordan Valley area, starting before 7 kya and, in a westward shift, that this was gradually superposed onto pre-existing local western populations of the same genus, especially in the Nile valley.

Here, we use the widespread European honeybee (Apis mellifera) to understand whether its Grinnelian and Eltonian niches changed in its exotic distribution using tests of abiotic and biotic niche conservatism. We found that both niche domains of the European honeybee remained stable in its exotic distribution, which means that neither the climatic niche nor the biotic specialization showed significant differences between the native and the exotic ranges.

Using a recently compiled database of parasite occurrences, we compare different models which we use to infer parasite geographic ranges and parasite species richness across the globe. Innovation To date, most studies exploring spatial patterns of parasite diversity assumed, with little validation, that the geographic range of a parasite species can be represented by the collective geographic range of its host species. Our study compares this assumption with a suite of other methods to infer parasite distribution from parasite occurrence data (e.g., based on data density, ecoregions and climatic conditions). We highlight diversity hotspots identified by the various methods and compare the effects of sampling intensities in different regions, a crucial factor determining observed parasite diversity. Main conclusions The type of model used to infer parasite distributions affects estimates of both total species richness and spatial patterns of hotspots of parasite richness. Overall, the models based on reported occurrences share similar areas of high parasite richness that tend to be biased towards areas of high sampling effort. In contrast, the model based on host distributions showed hotspots of parasite diversity that are biased towards areas of high host species richness. Accounting for sampling effort could only help to reconcile the outcome from the different models in some regions. Further, the non‐saturated species accumulation curves even for the best studied regions of the world such as Europe and North America serve as a call for further sampling effort and development of effective analytic tools that can provide robust accounts of global parasite diversity.",2020,2020-03-27 04:25:33,2021-01-24 05:49:54,,182-193,,1,29,,,,,,,en,,,124779e3-9202-3cef-938d-81ca38e0170e,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1111/geb.13008,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/TCGLAW25/Pappalardo et al. - 2020 - Comparing methods for mapping global parasite dive.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/geb.13008,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1466-822X,1466-8238",1466-822X,Global Ecology and Biogeography,Wiley,2019-10-24,2019,Comparing methods for mapping global parasite diversity,2021-12-03T16:48:26.153409,

Jatropha curcas gained popularity as a biodiesel crop, due to its ease of cultivation even in harsh environmental conditions. Notwithstanding its high economic importance, few studies are available about its co‐occurrence with pests of the genus Aphthona in sub‐Saharan Africa, where these insects feed on J. curcas, leading to relevant economic losses. Using ecological niche modelling and GIS post‐modelling analyses, we infer the current and future suitable territories for both these taxa, delineating areas where J. curcas cultivations may occur without suffering the presence of Aphthona, in the context of future climate and land use changing.

Moreover, we find high economic losses (~−50%) both in terms of carbon sequestration and in biodiesel production when J. curcas co‐occur with the Aphthona cookei species group.",2020,2020-09-10 02:27:36,2021-01-24 05:48:29,,gcbb.12727,,,,,,,,,,en,,,a4cc9c28-b7e0-3572-83e9-11311ed96df1,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1111/gcbb.12727,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/QAG5W49R/De Simone et al. - 2020 - Assessing influence in biofuel production and ecos.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/gcbb.12727,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,"1757-1693,1757-1707",1757-1693,GCB Bioenergy,Wiley,2020-08-01,2020,Assessing influence in biofuel production and ecosystem services when environmental changes affect plant–pest relationships,2021-03-28T20:33:07.994631,

One way to fit a spatial point process model is to apply logistic regression to an artificial case–control sample consisting of the observed presence records combined with a simulated pattern of background points, usually a uniform random sample from within the study’s spatial domain. In this paper we propose local background sampling as an alternative to uniform background sampling when using logistic regression to fit spatial point process models to data. Our method is similar to the local case–control sampling procedure of Fithian and Hastie (Ann Appl Stat 42:1693–1724, 2014), but differs in that background points are sampled with probability proportional to an initial intensity estimate based on a pilot point process model. We compare local background sampling with uniform background sampling in a simulation study and in an example modelling the distributions of bumble bees (genus Bombus) in Ontario, Canada.

This distribution has long fascinated biogeographers as potential support for Wegener’s theory of continental drift, with alternative scenarios invoking either Antarctic or Beringian range expansions. Here, we present the discovery of pollen grains from Early Campanian (ca. 82 Mya) deposits in Antarctica, which we describe as Coriaripites goodii sp. nov., and newly generated nuclear and plastid molecular data for most of the family’s species and its outgroup. This greatly expands the family’s fossil record and is the so far oldest fossil of the order Cucurbitales. We used the phylogeny, new fossil, and an Oligocene flowering branch assigned to a small subclade of Coriaria to generate a chronogram and to study changes in chromosome number, deciduousness, and andromonoecy. Coriaria comprises a Northern (NH) and a Southern Hemisphere (SH) clade that diverged from each other in the Paleocene (ca. 57 Mya), with the SH clade reaching the New World once, through Antarctica, as supported by the fossil pollen. While the SH clade retained perfect flowers and evergreen leaves, the NH clade evolved andromonoecy and deciduousness.

However, the potential uses of these data are limited by the gaps and biases associated to large-scale distributional databases (the so-called Wallacean shortfall). Describing and quantifying these limitations are essential to improve knowledge on biodiversity, especially in poorly-studied groups, such as mosses. Here we assess the coverage of the publicly-available distributional information on Iberian mosses, defining its eventual biases and gaps. For this purpose, we compiled IberBryo v1.0, a database that comprises 82,582 records after processing and checking the geospatial and taxonomical information. Our results show the limitations of data and metadata of the publicly-available information. Particularly, ca. 42% of the records lacked collecting date information, which limits data usefulness for time coverage analyses and enlarges the existing knowledge gaps. Then we evaluated the overall coverage of several aspects of the spatial, temporal and environmental variability of the Iberian Peninsula. Through this assessment, we demonstrate that the publicly-available information on Iberian mosses presents significant biases. Inventory completeness is strongly conditioned by the recorders' survey bias, particularly in northern Portugal and eastern Spain and the spatial pattern of surveys is also biased towards mountains. Besides, the temporal pattern of survey effort intensifies from 1970 onwards, encompassing a progressive increase in the geographic coverage of the Iberian Peninsula. Although we just found 5% of well-surveyed cells of 30’ of resolution over the 1970-2018 period, they cover about a fifth of the main climatic gradients of the Iberian Peninsula, which provides a fair – though limited – coverage. Yet, the well-surveyed cells are biased towards anthropised areas and some of them are located in areas under intense land-use changes, mainly due to the wood-fires of the last decade. Despite the overall increase, we found a noticeable gap of information in the south-west of Iberia, the Ebro river basin and the inner plateaus. All these gaps and biases call for a careful use of the available distributional data of Iberian mosses for biogeographical and ecological modelling analysis. Further, our results highlight the necessity of incorporating several good practices to increase the coverage of high-quality information. These good practices include digitalisation of specimens and metadata information, improvement on the protocols to get accurate data and metadata or revisions of the vouchers and recorders' field notebooks. These procedures are essential to improve the quality and coverage of the data. Finally, we also encourage Iberian bryologists to establish a series of re-surveys of classical localities that would allow updating the information on the group, as well as to design their future surveys considering the most important information gaps on IberBryo.",2020,2020-11-03 01:00:13,2021-01-24 05:34:45,,e53474,,,8,,,,,,,,,,2193eb17-e6e4-3b98-9e2c-b5e413832c31,,Script,,10.3897/BDJ.8.e53474,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/4SSQ94BB/Ronquillo et al. - 2020 - Assessing spatial and temporal biases and gaps in .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.3897/BDJ.8.e53474,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

However, online biodiversity information is biased spatially as a result of slow and uneven capture and digitization of existing data resources. The West African Plants Initiative approach to data capture is a prototype of a novel solution to the problems of the traditional model, in which the institutional “owner” of the specimens is responsible for digital capture of associated data. METHODS: We developed customized workflows for data capture in formats directly and permanently useful to the “owner” herbarium, and digitized significant numbers of new biodiversity records, adding to the information available for the plants of the region. RESULTS: In all, 190,953 records of species in 1965 genera and 331 families were captured by mid-2018. These data records covered 16 West African countries, with most of the records (10,000–99,999) from Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Cameroon, and the fewest data records from Mauritania (<100 records). The West African Plants Initiative has increased available digital accessible knowledge records for West African plants by about 54%. Several of the project institutions have put initial project data online as part of their Global Biodiversity Information Facility data contributions. The average cost of data capture ranged from US$0.50−1.00 per herbarium sheet. DISCUSSION: Data capture has been cost-effective because it is much less expensive than de novo field collections, allows for development of information resources even for regions in which political situations make contemporary field sampling impossible, and provides a historical baseline against which to compare newer data as they become available. This new paradigm in specimen digitization has considerable promise to accelerate and improve the process of generating high-quality biodiversity information, and can be replicated and applied in many biodiversity-rich, information-poor regions to remedy the present massive gaps in information availability.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 05:32:57,,,,1,8,,,,,,,en,,,63bda6f3-3ea5-3070-84c0-1bc9fba1e966,,Script,,10.1002/aps3.11318,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/F3FVWLUH/Asase et al. - 2020 - A new model for efficient, need‐driven progress in.pdf",,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1002/aps3.11318,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"2168-0450,2168-0450",2168-0450,Applications in Plant Sciences,Wiley,2020-01-01,2020,"A new model for efficient, need‐driven progress in generating primary biodiversity information resources",2021-11-29T03:11:27.978480,

We find that populations from poleward edges perform relatively poorly, both on average across all sites (15% lower population quality) and when compared to other populations at home (31% relative fitness disadvantage), consistent with these populations harboring high genetic load. Populations from equatorial edges also perform poorly on average (18% lower population quality) but, in contrast, outperform foreign populations (16% relative fitness advantage), suggesting that populations from equatorial edges are specialized to unique environments.

To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993–2003 and 2003–2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-22 07:12:41,,8,,1,20,,,,,,,en,,,216d9c51-06e4-3809-b869-f1cd0a1ab948,,Script,,10.1007/s10113-020-01603-y,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/UG6EV8JB/Sánchez-Cuervo et al. - 2020 - Twenty years of land cover change in the southeast.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

This study aimed to assess geographic distribution of genetic variation of this widespread mangrove in the Indo‐West Pacific region and identify the phylogeographic factors influencing its present‐day distribution. Analysis of five chloroplast DNA fragments’ sequences from 37 populations revealed low genetic diversity at the population level and strong genetic structure of H. littoralis in this region. The estimated divergence times between the major genetic lineages indicated that glacial level changes during the Pleistocene epoch induced strong genetic differentiation across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In comparison to the strong genetic break imposed by the Sunda Shelf toward splitting the lineages of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the genetic differentiation between Indo‐Malesia and Australasia was not so prominent. Long‐distance dispersal ability of H. littoralis propagules helped the species to attain transoceanic distribution not only across South East Asia and Australia, but also across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. However, oceanic circulation pattern in the South China Sea was found to act as a barrier creating further intraoceanic genetic differentiation. Overall, phylogeographic analysis in this study revealed that glacial vicariance had profound influence on population differentiation in H. littoralis and caused low genetic diversity except for the refugia populations near the equator which might have persisted through glacial maxima. With increasing loss of suitable habitats due to anthropogenic activities, these findings therefore emphasize the urgent need for conservation actions for all populations throughout the distribution range of H. littoralis .",2020,2020-07-08 02:02:05,2021-01-22 07:12:28,,ece3.6460,,,,,,,,,,en,,,3b97ce34-7736-367e-be05-87a91f9029b8,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1002/ece3.6460,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/DPTB6K9M/Banerjee et al. - 2020 - Land masses and oceanic currents drive population .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1002/ece3.6460,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"2045-7758,2045-7758",2045-7758,Ecology and Evolution,Wiley,2020-06-03,2020,"Land masses and oceanic currents drive population structure ofHeritiera littoralis, a widespread mangrove in the Indo‐West Pacific",2021-04-01T03:34:42.928712,

This extended leaf phenology is thought to grant invasive species an advantage over native species because spring and fall are crucial times for light access and carbon acquisition in understory habitats. However, it is unclear whether this advantage persists at northern latitudes where freezing temperatures constrain growing season length and low light levels reduce carbon gain. To investigate the costs and benefits of extended leaf phenology at northern latitudes, we observed leaf phenology, estimated total carbon gain, measured growth, and tested susceptibility to freezing temperatures for four native and four invasive woody shrubs in a disturbed forest in northern Minnesota, USA. We found that the invaders leafed out simultaneously with the natives in the spring but retained their leaves later in the autumn than native species. This extended fall phenology did not enable greater total carbon gain for the invaders because they assimilated less carbon earlier in the year than the natives. There was also no significant difference between native and invasive species in their susceptibility to freezing temperatures. Instead freezing tolerance related more to native range then leaf phenology.

Extant phylogeographic patterns of terrestrial circum-Mediterranean faunas were mainly shaped through Pleistocene range shifts and range fragmentations due to retreat into different glacial refugia. Thus, several extant Mediterranean bird species have diversified by surviving glaciations in different hospitable refugia and subsequently expanded their distribution ranges during the Holocene. Such a scenario was also suggested for the Eurasian Wren (Nannus troglodytes) despite the lack of genetic data for most Mediterranean subspecies. Our phylogenetic multi-locus analysis comprised 18 out of 28 currently accepted subspecies of N. troglodytes, including all but one subspecies which are present in the Mediterranean Basin. The resulting phylogenetic reconstruction dated the onset of the entire Holarctic radiation of three Nannus species to the early Pleistocene. In the Eurasian Wren, two North African subspecies represented separate basal lineages from the Maghreb (N. t. kabylorum) and from the Libyan Cyrenaica (N. t. juniperi), being only distantly related to other Mediterranean populations. Although N. troglodytes appeared to be paraphyletic with respect to the Nearctic Winter Wren (N. hiemalis), respective nodes did not receive strong statistical support. In contrast, paraphyly of the Ibero-Maghrebian taxon N. t. kabylorum was strongly supported. Southern Iberian populations of N. t. kabylorum did not clade with Maghrebian populations of the same subspecies but formed a sister clade to a highly diverse European clade (including nominate N. t. troglodytes and eight further taxa). In accordance with a pattern also found in other birds, Eurasian populations were split into a western clade (Europe, Caucasus) and an eastern clade (Central Asia, Sino-Himalayas, East Asia).

In addition to direct effects of climate on species, there can also be indirect effects through an intermediary species, such as in host–plant interactions. Indirect effects are expected to be more pronounced in alpine environments because these ecosystems are sensitive to temperature changes and there are limited areas for migration of both species (i.e. closed systems), and because of simpler trophic interactions. We tested the hypothesis that climate change will reduce the range of an alpine butterfly (Parnassius smintheus) because of indirect effects through its host plant (Sedum sp.). To test for direct and indirect effects, we used the simulations of climate change to assess the distribution of P. smintheus with and without Sedum sp. We also compared the projected ranges of P. smintheus to four other butterfly species that are found in the alpine, but that are generalists feeding on many plant genera. We found that P. smintheus gained distributional area in climate‐only models, but these gains were significantly reduced with the inclusion of Sedum sp. and in dry‐climate scenarios which resulted in a reduction in net area. When compared to the more generalist butterfly species, P. smintheus exhibited the largest loss in suitable habitat. Our findings support the importance of including indirect effects in modelling species distributions in response to climate change. We highlight the potentially large and still neglected impacts climate change can have on the trophic structure of communities, which can lead to significant losses of biodiversity.

In order to understand how the realized niche of the species was affected by this dramatic geographic range expansion, we reconstructed the history of the geographic range expansion. We built models of the realized niche of the species at different points in time during the invasion process. This was achieved through the implementation of modern hypervolume construction methods, based on the Hutchinson’s niche concept. The models were then compared to detect possible realized climatic niche expansion over time. Furthermore, we investigated possible pathways used by the species to spread. A progressive expansion of the realized niche was identified. As the species spread into new areas, we observed a tendency to colonize regions with warmer temperatures and higher precipitation rates. Finally, we found evidence for cargo shipping being the major pathway through which the species expands its range.

In agricultural pest management, this has implications for sowing dates and pest monitoring. In the last 20 years, the European earwig (Forficula auricularia), a cosmopolitan pest, has been increasingly implicated in damage to grain crops in Australia. Among these, rapeseed, Brassica napus, appears especially at risk, but little information on F. auricularia as a grain pest is available. We tested the susceptibility of seven grain crops commonly grown in Australia to infestation by F. auricularia using closed microcosm experiments, exposing plant seedlings at two early growth stages to four different life stages of F. auricularia. Lucerne and rapeseed were shown to be the most vulnerable crops, and younger seedlings experienced significantly more damage than older seedlings across all crop types. Fourth instar F. auricularia were found to cause greater feeding damage than younger or older earwigs, while adults collected in winter generally caused more damage than those collected in summer. Surprisingly, even second instar F. auricularia caused greater damage than summer adults. This variation could reflect the ontogenetically dynamic nutritional needs of earwigs. Recent studies of F. auricularia's life cycle in southern Australia indicate that these damaging life stages have some overlap with sowing dates of the crops tested here, exposing their vulnerable seedling stage to infestation. The phenology of F. auricularia in southern Australia therefore partly drives its ability to act as a pest. Future monitoring will likely need to track the distribution of F. auricularia life stages in order to effectively mitigate risks to vulnerable crops.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-21 10:30:14,,605-615,,7,144,,,,,,,en,,,6cd38dd8-8523-3da6-97b3-a7a168b4ddde,,Script,,10.1111/jen.12767,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/7SUXSTSQ/Kirkland et al. - 2020 - Ontogeny in the European earwig ( Forficula auricu.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jen.12767,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0931-2048,1439-0418",0931-2048,Journal of Applied Entomology,Wiley,2020-08-01,2020,Ontogeny in the European earwig ( Forficula auricularia ) and grain crops interact to exacerbate feeding damage risk,2021-10-12T03:38:49.772280,

It encompasses multiple key components including range size, which is one of the most commonly measured estimates of geographic rarity. Range size estimates are often used to prioritize conservation efforts when there are multiple candidate species, because data for other components of rarity such as population size are sparse, or do not exist for species of interest. Range size estimates can provide rankings of species vulnerability to changing environments or threats, identifying rare species for future study or conservation initiatives. However, range sizes can be estimated by several different metrics, and the degree of overlap in the identification of the rarest or most common species across methodologies is not well understood. This knowledge gap compromises our ability to prioritize correctly rare species, and presents a particularly difficult challenge for stream-dwelling organisms with distributions constrained to river networks. We evaluated the relationship of multiple range size estimates of a subset of freshwater fishes native to the United States to determine the degree of overlap in rarity rankings using different data sources and grain sizes. We used publicly available, open access data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( ) to calculate extent of occurrence (minimum convex polygons) and area of occupancy (total area occupied, measured across various grain sizes). We compared range sizes estimated using   data with the best available estimates of current distributions described by publicly available digital maps (NatureServe) to evaluate the efficacy of   data in assessments of range size. We found strong correlations between range size estimates across analytical approaches and data sources with no detectable bias of taxonomy. We found that variation among rarity rankings was highest for species with intermediate range sizes indicating that the approaches considered here generally converge when used to identify the rarest or the most common species. Importantly, our results show that the rarest, and perhaps the most vulnerable, species are consistently identified across common methodological approaches. More broadly, our results support the use of open access biodiversity data that include opportunistically collated and collected point occurrence records as a complement to coarse-grain (e.g., whole range map) approaches, as we observed no systematic bias or deviation across data sources in our analyses.

We investigate how plant height is associated with both aspects of diversification in Alooideae, a large plant subfamily with its center of diversity in the Greater Cape Floristic Region. We first reconstruct a time-calibrated phylogeny for Alooideae and demonstrate an evolutionary tendency towards reduced plant height. While plant height does not correlate with diversification rate across Alooideae it does so with diversification per unit space: clades of small plants tend to have the highest diversification densities.

In the second stage, we develop an ensemble model using various habitat suitability estimation methods based on observations, environmental data, and the results of the DNN from the first stage. For reliable estimation of habitat suitability, we utilize various crowdsourced databases. Using observational and environmental data for four amphibian species and seven bird species in South Korea, we demonstrate that our scheme provides a more accurate estimation of habitat suitability compared to previous other approaches.

Results Climatic niche similarity was higher than random expectation in 56% of species, and human disturbance niche similarity in 43%. Only 34 and 15% of species had >10% of their alien distribution in climates or human conditions, respectively, different from those of native ranges. Climatic niche expansions mostly involved colonization of colder and less seasonal climates. Human niche expansions involved colonization of more disturbed environments by species not responding positively to human influence in native ranges. Climatic and human niche unfilling was more common than expansions and was lower for species introduced earlier and those responding positively to human influence. Models including human variables do equally well for all species. Main conclusions Alien birds tend to invade areas with similar climatic and human conditions to their native range, but niche unfilling and expansions occur and relate to species native tolerances to human‐modified habitats and first introduction year. Incorporation of human‐related variables in SDM results in more accurate predictions for all species.",2020,2020-09-10 02:27:36,2021-01-21 10:25:12,,geb.13166,,,,,,,,,,en,,,e4fa1424-6e94-34ea-8068-73cb54f59739,,Script,,10.1111/geb.13166,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/ZXFYJW6U/Cardador - Supplementary Information.docx; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/6LUULE8K/Cardador and Blackburn - 2020 - A global assessment of human influence on niche sh.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/geb.13166,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"1466-822X,1466-8238",1466-822X,Global Ecology and Biogeography,Wiley,2020-08-07,2020,A global assessment of human influence on niche shifts and risk predictions of bird invasions,2021-11-26T22:20:59.689595,

Here we develop a tool to rank Key Biodiversity Areas in a continuous scale to allow the ranking between KBAs and test this tool on a simulated dataset of 10 000 scenarios of species compositions of reptiles and mammals in eight locations in Mozambique. Location Mozambique, Africa Methods We compare the KBA criteria with four priorisation metrics (weighted endemism, extinction risk, evolutionary distinctiveness and EDGE score) to rank the biodiversity importance of eight sites with a randomly generated species composition of reptiles and mammals in Mozambique. Results We find that none of these metrics is able to provide a suitable ranking of the sites surveyed that would ultimately allow prioritization. We therefore develop and validate the “WEGE index” (Weighted Endemism including Global Endangerment index), which is an adaptation of the EDGE score (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) and allows the ranking of sites according to the KBA criteria but on a continuous scale. Main conclusions For our study system, the WEGE index scores areas that trigger KBA status higher and is able to rank their importance in terms of biodiversity by using the range and threat status of species present at the site. Prioritization may be crucial for policy making and real-life conservation, allowing the choice between otherwise equally qualified sites according to the KBA categories.

To assess if wood anatomy provides phylogenetic and/or ecological signal, we compiled data on wood traits and climatic variables from the distributions of 53 species. Wood traits counteracting cavitation correlated with higher temperature and precipitation seasonality; simultaneously they were better expressed in species with smaller maximal plant height.

The aim of this study was to determine the locations of current suitable climatic niches for this shrub and to estimate future spatial changes in their locations using ecological niche modelling tools. Model results showed that S. tomentosa has large potential natural and secondary ranges, much larger than the range estimated using presence data only. The potential modelled current distribution of S. tomentosa in North America included areas with a relatively humid climate and corresponded with its climate envelope, but in Eurasia, favourable climatic conditions for the shrub occurred in a much larger area than indicated by its current invasive range, so the shrub has not realised its potential climatic niche. Species distribution in its secondary range seems to be random, which may indicate that its true dispersal capacity in Eurasia has not yet been realised. The models showed that climate changes could alter the distribution of the suitable climatic niches available for S. tomentosa, and favour its continuing spread. The shrub could retain the majority of its currently occupied positions in both natural and secondary ranges and simultaneously extend its latitudinal range towards the west in North America and towards the east in Eurasia. In the case of its longitudinal distribution, there may be a shift in the available climate niches to the north, mainly to Scandinavia, and to the south, pushing the shrubs towards mountainous areas with a colder climate. As both current and forecasted future climate conditions seem to favour the consolidation of S. tomentosa populations as well as the extension of its second range in Eurasia, appropriate management strategies should limit or prevent further invasion. It is crucial to limit the intentional and accidental transfer of the shrub, heighten vigilance to identify and eradicate new invasion foci, identify and implement appropriate control techniques and raise public awareness of the invasion threat posed by the species.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-21 10:23:37,,e01226,,,24,,,,,,,en,,,9727d691-e429-3fce-81dd-c3ba02660877,,Script,,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01226,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/JGI28RHA/Wiatrowska et al. - 2020 - Current occurrence and potential future climatic n.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01226,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,2351-9894,2351-9894,Global Ecology and Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-12-01,2020,Current occurrence and potential future climatic niche distribution of the invasive shrub Spiraea tomentosa L. in its native and non-native ranges,2021-07-31T16:55:05.885009,

However, little attention is paid to using updated taxonomy in these “biodiversity big data” repositories and the quality of their taxonomic information is often questioned. Here we assess how reliable is the current use of nomenclatural classification in the distributional information available from two biodiversity information networks: GBIF and the Brazilian SpeciesLink. We use as a study case the records of Auchenipteridae, a Neotropical fish family that has been subject to recent taxonomical reviews. A data filtering procedure was applied to identify and quantify the inaccuracies in the taxonomical status of the records in three steps: assessment of identification accuracy at the family, genus or species level; current validity of species name; and assignation of inaccurate species records to different categories of classification quality. Synonyms, nonexistent combinations, and outdated combinations were reassigned to currently valid species. A total of 9148 records of Auchenipteridae fishes were analyzed, of which 4165 were from GBIF and 4983 from SpeciesLink, deriving from 46 and 31 sources, respectively. After correcting all possible records following the taxonomic data filtering steps, 6988 records (76.4% of the original) were adequate for describing species distributions, while 2160 remained inaccurate. The most inaccurate records at the species level were due to the use of outdated nomenclatures, resulting in non-valid combinations of species and genus, and synonymy. Our results evidence a large taxonomic inconsistency among records, and, most importantly, that taxonomic information obtained from repositories should be used with caution. Many inaccuracy issues may be embedded in the biodiversity databases’ records, which could lead researchers to provide an incomplete or even mistaken perspective of the variations in the natural world.",2020,2020-05-01 06:26:54,2021-01-21 10:20:54,,1-11,,,,,,,,,,en,,,07c5deca-6deb-3e94-9339-18080b8246d4,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1080/14772000.2020.1730473,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/X82574E6/Freitas et al. - 2020 - How reliable are species identifications in biodiv.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1080/14772000.2020.1730473,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"1477-2000,1478-0933",1477-2000,Systematics and Biodiversity,Informa UK Limited,2020-02-17,2020,How reliable are species identifications in biodiversity big data?

We describe patterns of plant genetic variation across the Cerrado biome, highlighting areas of high diversity and priority areas for conservation. We also analyze the relative importance of environmental characteristics and human footprints on patterns of genetic variation. Raw genetic data comes primarily from central and southeastern Brazil, outside conservation units (CUs). Standardized estimated genetic richness (Gest) decreases in a north–south gradient. Populations with high genetic diversity (He) and allelic richness (AR) are widespread across the biome, but both increase with distance from the center of Cerrado. Environmental variables related to energy, temperature and precipitation are associated with Gest and AR, but not He. Gest is higher in northern Cerrado, in regions with low human development index (HDI). Conversely, southern Cerrado shows higher HDI and lower genetic richness, most likely due to both high habitat fragmentation and loss. CUs in northern Cerrado tend to have higher Gest, whereas those in southeast and central Cerrado have higher He and AR. The high genetic diversity and richness in the few populations studied in northern Cerrado, coupled with the low data availability, reveal the importance of encouraging genetic studies in this region.

We aim to quantify the people in Europe and the entire Mediterranean area who are under risk associated with each of the three fungal pathogens in a spatially explicit way, generating a series of maps and population statistics per country. Niche modeling was applied to estimate the potential distribution of each fungal pathogen, then these models were overlapped with a map of population density to estimate risk levels. The potential number of people per risk level and per country was quantified using a map of population count per pixel.

We developed an ecological niche model and performed protected areas analysis to assess the current and future distribution of suitable habitat for the globally endangered wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) across the northeastern U.S. portion of its range. Our model predicts that by 2070 the suitable habitat for this species will decrease by 29–52%, and the total area of optimal habitat will decrease by 62–86%, depending on emissions scenario. Furthermore, currently only 5% of suitable habitat and 8% of optimal habitat is protected, with the total area of protected suitable and optimal habitat expected to decrease by 16–28% and 31–64%, respectively, by 2070. Our results suggest that long-term wood turtle conservation efforts should be directed towards protecting habitat in higher latitudes of their range, mainly in the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York where the majority of climate refugia exist.

When undocumented areas become deforested, in addition to losing the fauna and flora, we lose the opportunity to know which unique species had occupied a habitat. Here we quantify such knowledge loss by calculating how much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested and will likely be deforested until 2050 without having its tree flora sufficiently documented. To this end, we analysed 399 147 digital specimens of nearly 6000 tree species in relation to official deforestation statistics and future deforestation scenarios. We find that by 2017, 30% of all the localities where tree specimens had been collected were mostly deforested. Some 300 000km2 (12%; 485 25×25km grid cells) of the Brazilian Amazon had been deforested by 2017, without having a single tree specimen recorded. An additional 250 000–900 000km2 of severely under-collected rainforest will likely become deforested by 2050.

Niche theory relates both spatial scales by considering the resources (Eltonian niche) and conditions (Grinnellian niche) used by species and allow us to assess the contribution of these factors for species co‐occurrence. Indeed, combining local field data on diet preferences and climatic variables across species distributions can help us to evaluate their co‐occurrence while jointly considering resources and conditions on niche partitioning. Here, using information drawn from literature, we evaluated the relationship between geographic, climatic (Grinnellian) and trophic (Eltonian) niche dimensions among five highly sympatric felid species in favoring species co‐occurrence at broad spatial scales across the Neotropical region. We obtain potential geographic distributions of species through ecological niche models. Then, we calculated the pairwise species overlaps for each niche dimension and tested for a relationship between each pair of dimensions using Mantel and partial Mantel tests. We found a positive and significant relationship between geographic co‐occurrence and climatic overlap. This relationship remained after controlling for trophic overlap. Geographic and trophic overlap, as well as climatic and trophic overlap, did not show significant relationships.

Many of them played important roles as seed dispersers. In the case of the largest-seeded species, giant lemurs or elephant birds may have been the sole dispersers because no extant frugivore has a gape size large enough to ingest those seeds. These plant species now show all the hallmarks of anachronistic species. The consequences of dispersal gaps caused by megafaunal extinctions are exacerbated by the continuing decline of the range distribution of extant dispersers, particularly lemurs. In this paper, we identify dispersal gaps in Madagascar and highlight dysfunctional seed dispersal – systems in which plants have lost animal mutualists. We obtained data on seed dispersal, traits and distribution of plants and frugivores in Madagascar from the literature, online databases, and using herbarium specimens. We estimated the number of potential dispersers for each endemic endozoochorous plant species, by comparing the seed size of each plant species to the size of the largest seed that each frugivore can swallow whole. We estimated the number of available lemur dispersers by matching the distribution of plant species to the distribution of potential dispersers. We found that, out of the 3018 studied endozoochorous plant species, two species have experienced the complete extinction of their main dispersers while 487 species suffer from the local extinction of their suitable dispersers. A limited number of dispersers could be one of the main reasons why most of these plant species are now on the edge of extinction.",2020,2020-03-26 02:29:48,2021-01-21 10:13:31,,108438,,,242,,,,,,,en,,,664f8b6e-1759-3241-8d94-26147dce6b7a,,Script,,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108438,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/JRMDXLZY/Albert-Daviaud et al. - 2020 - The ghost fruits of Madagascar Identifying dysfun.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108438,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0006-3207,0006-3207,Biological Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-02-01,2020,The ghost fruits of Madagascar: Identifying dysfunctional seed dispersal in Madagascar's endemic flora,2021-01-12T22:46:16.939504,

Climate‐matching approaches comparing native and exotic ranges mostly consider temperature and precipitation niches of alien species, but have largely ignored UV‐B radiation. UV‐B fundamentally differs between hemispheres, with much higher levels at southern than at northern latitudes. Consequently, UV‐B might act at the global scale and present a so far neglected filter that species need to overcome when invading high‐UV‐B environments. Location We performed two multi‐species common garden experiments, conducted in the native European range (Germany) and the high‐UV‐B exotic range (New Zealand) to test for preadaptation to UV‐B. Methods We used 25 herbaceous species from open habitats, which we exposed in each range to three UV radiation treatments: (a) natural sunlight, (b) exclusion of UV‐B while allowing natural UV‐A, and (c) exclusion of UV‐B and UV‐A. We additionally used plant traits (TRY), global distribution data (GBIF, GloNAF) and global UV‐B satellite data (glUV) to determine species‐specific characteristics as fostering agents of UV‐B tolerance. The joint analysis of experimental and macroecological data allowed quantification of species plasticity and identification of beneficial species traits in high‐UV‐B environments. Results Our results showed an overall limiting effect of UV‐B in both common gardens but the UV‐stress response tended to be more pronounced in the invaded range. Across all species, we found little evidence for preadaptation by functional plant traits. In contrast, preadaptation to climatic conditions related to the species’ native UV‐B niche was of greater importance for plant performance in the presence of UV‐B radiation. Main conclusions For predicting alien species’ ability to expand into high‐UV‐B environments, macroclimatic niche characteristics of the species’ native range might be better predictors than functional traits and should be more considered in future projection models.",2020,2020-08-03 04:48:00,2021-01-21 10:12:50,,ddi.13113,,,,,,,,,,en,,,eef5ecfe-fd91-3569-a5dc-ed6db7586ca2,,Script,,10.1111/ddi.13113,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/SWRX2AK4/Hock et al. - 2020 - Native distribution characteristics rather than fu.pdf; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/7MCDQTSS/Hock - Supplementary Information.docx,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/ddi.13113,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"1366-9516,1472-4642",1366-9516,Diversity and Distributions,Wiley,2020-07-06,2020,Native distribution characteristics rather than functional traits explain preadaptation of invasive species to high‐UV‐B environments,2021-10-13T13:46:39.115071,

Because the functional traits of plants influence the performance of individuals under different environmental conditions, we aimed to describe the functional traits of the most frequent tree species found in the Brazilian Mixed Subtropical Forest. We also aimed to test whether functional traits could be used to predict the impact of climate change on the future distribution of tree species. For selected species, certain functional traits were described, namely, wood density, leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf renovation regime, dispersal syndrome, maximum potential height, fruit type, presence of seed dormancy, and the desiccation tolerance of seeds. The geographical distributions of the selected species were modeled using the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) as a function of climatic variation. To predict the impact of climatic changes by 2070 relative to current climate, the best and worst scenarios in relation to the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) were used. While the best scenario assumes a strong reduction in GHG anthropogenic emissions, turning negative by 2070, the worst scenario assumes a continuous increase in GHG anthropogenic emissions over time. The functional traits were ordinated by Principal Components Analysis to identify the ecological strategies of each species. The relationship between functional traits and changes to the area of climatic suitability of each species was evaluated using regression trees. Functional traits predicted changes to suitable climatic areas in the worst-case scenario only. The suitable climatic area of more leathery leaf species was predicted to decline by 41.0% on average, whereas that of more membranous leaf species was predicted to decline by 14.0%. In particular, Araucaria angustifolia, which is considered the most representative species of the Mixed Subtropical Forest of Brazil, had the highest sensitivity to climate change. Consequently, our results suggest that this important forest formation will be strongly impacted by climate and will be under severe risk in the future.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 06:51:38,,106477,,,116,,,,,,,en,,,2fac9f98-9bea-399e-ab99-afe03b9cda02,,Script,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106477,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/AUVATQ9Q/Bohora Schlickmann et al. - 2020 - Specific leaf area is a potential indicator of tre.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106477,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1470-160X,1470-160X,Ecological Indicators,Elsevier BV,2020-09-01,2020,Specific leaf area is a potential indicator of tree species sensitive to future climate change in the mixed Subtropical Forests of southern Brazil,2021-03-11T13:10:46.798967,

Using species occurrence data (presence-only) and environmental variables obtained from publicly available databases, we developed species distribution models under the current and future climate conditions and then compared how much their ranges and the overlap between the cuckoo and hosts are predicted to change owing to climate change. The amount of suitable habitats for the lesser cuckoo and for most host species was predicted to decrease, all the while the ranges generally shifted northward. Climate change also decreased the amount of overlap between the lesser cuckoo and its hosts. This is a mechanism that may significantly shrink the realised range of the lesser cuckoo and should therefore be taken into account in range projections. These results provide evidence that climate change affects cuckoos not only through altered abiotic factors but also because cuckoos and hosts could react differently to such changes, jeopardizing the ability of parasites to track their climate envelope.",2020,2020-05-01 06:26:54,2021-01-24 06:49:22,,e00976,,,22,,,,,,,en,,,ddbeacbe-62b9-3f91-a434-955a8c36bdc2,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00976,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/68BN9Z8E/Yun et al. - 2020 - Host-parasite interaction augments climate change .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00976,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,2351-9894,2351-9894,Global Ecology and Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-06-01,2020,"Host-parasite interaction augments climate change effect in an avian brood parasite, the lesser cuckoo Cuculus poliocephalus",2021-07-30T16:31:42.920847,

Two subspecies L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica, collectively referred to as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) are of special concern as they have traits that make them better invaders than their European counterpart (e.g. flight capability of females). We assessed the potential distribution of AGM in Canada using two presence-only species distribution models, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). In addition, we mapped AGM potential future distribution under two climate change scenarios (A1B and A2) while implementing dispersal constraints using the cellular automation model MigClim. MaxEnt had higher AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores (0.82/1.40/1.00) when compared to GARP (0.70/1.26/0.9), indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for AGM. The models indicated that suitable conditions for AGM were present in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Shorter or longer distance dispersal is favored by different dispersal modes, facilitating (or constraining) population isolation, which can, in turn, impact speciation and species range sizes. While these associations are intuitive, few studies have explicitly tested these hypotheses for large clades of angiosperms. The plant family Melastomataceae is found on disparate habitats with different dispersal modes, representing a good model to address these questions. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Melastomataceae and gather data on their dispersal mode and range size to test the impact of dispersal mode on diversification and range size evolution. We found that abiotic dispersal is ancestral in the family, while biotic dispersal evolved multiple times. Species richness distribution is very similar across dispersal modes, although abiotically dispersed species tend to be relatively more diverse in seasonal environments. Range sizes across dispersal modes are not significantly different, although biotically dispersed species have slightly wider distributions. Model comparisons indicate that factors other than dispersal mode might have driven diversification heterogeneity. We did not find evidence for the role of dispersal mode driving diversification rates or range size in the Melastomataceae, suggesting a complex macroevolutionary scenario for this diverse angiosperm family. The bulk of changes to biotic dispersal coinciding with an increase in passerine diversification suggests a possible “past” key innovation in Melastomataceae. Future studies should investigate the role of other diversification drivers in the family and the relatively higher diversity of abiotically dispersed species in open habitats.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 06:48:11,,106815,,,148,,,,,,,en,,,86ce5ffc-fc8e-30a5-ae58-16e21fb66b8d,,Script,,10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106815,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/MVI92F2C/Reginato et al. - 2020 - Is dispersal mode a driver of diversification and .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106815,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1055-7903,1055-7903,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,Elsevier BV,2020-07-01,2020,Is dispersal mode a driver of diversification and geographical distribution in the tropical plant family Melastomataceae?,2021-08-20T11:22:04.625898,

Effective conservation management requires more thorough biodiversity surveys that can reveal system-level patterns and that can be applied rapidly across space and time. We offer a way to use environmental DNA, community science and remote sensing together as methods to reduce the discrepancy between the magnitude of change and historical approaches to measure it. Taking advantages of modern ecological models, we integrate environmental DNA and Earth observations to evaluate regional biodiversity patterns for a snapshot of time, and provide critical community-level characterization. We collected 278 samples in Spring 2017 from coastal, shrub and lowland forest sites in California, a large-scale biodiversity hotspot. We applied gradient forest to model 915 family occurrences and community composition together with environmental variables and multi-scalar habitat classifications to produce a statewide biodiversity-based map. 16,118 taxonomic entries recovered were associated with environmental variables to test their predictive strength on alpha, beta, and zeta diversity. Local habitat classification was diagnostic of community composition, illuminating a characteristic of biodiversity hotspots. Using gradient forest models, environmental variables predicted 35% of the variance in eDNA patterns at the family level, with elevation, sand percentage, and greenness (NDVI32) as the top predictors. This predictive power was higher than we found in published literature at global scale. In addition to this indication of substantial environmental filtering, we also found a positive relationship between environmentally predicted families and their numbers of biotic interactions. In aggregate, these analyses showed that strong eDNA community-environment correlation is a general characteristic of temperate ecosystems, and may explain why communities easily destabilize under disturbances.

Choices regarding optimal models, methods and data are typically made based on discrimination accuracy: a model's ability to predict subsets of species occurrence data that were withheld during model construction. However, empirical applications of these models often involve making biological inferences based on continuous estimates of relative habitat suitability as a function of environmental predictor variables. We term the reliability of these biological inferences ‘functional accuracy.’ We explore the link between discrimination accuracy and functional accuracy. Methods Using a simulation approach we investigate whether models that make good predictions of species distributions correctly infer the underlying relationship between environmental predictors and the suitability of habitat. Results We demonstrate that discrimination accuracy is only informative when models are simple and similar in structure to the true niche, or when data partitioning is geographically structured. However, the utility of discrimination accuracy for selecting models with high functional accuracy was low in all cases. Main conclusions These results suggest that many empirical studies and decisions are based on criteria that are unrelated to models’ usefulness for their intended purpose. We argue that empirical modelling studies need to place significantly more emphasis on biological insight into the plausibility of models, and that the current approach of maximizing discrimination accuracy at the expense of other considerations is detrimental to both the empirical and methodological literature in this active field. Finally, we argue that future development of the field must include an increased emphasis on simulation; methodological studies based on ability to predict withheld occurrence data may be largely uninformative about best practices for applications where interpretation of models relies on estimating ecological processes, and will unduly penalize more biologically informative modelling approaches.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:24,2021-01-24 06:47:05,,167-180,,1,47,,,,,,,en,,,cb4e9ca6-b1c0-3a32-bd9b-4d9f99ed357f,,Script,,10.1111/jbi.13705,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/RQYYH4UK/Warren et al. - 2020 - Evaluating presence‐only species distribution mode.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jbi.13705,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0305-0270,1365-2699",0305-0270,Journal of Biogeography,Wiley,2019-09-20,2019,Evaluating presence‐only species distribution models with discrimination accuracy is uninformative for many applications,2021-11-05T18:03:37.706904,

They derive from geo-referenced specimens deposited in natural history collections and visual observations, such as those obtained through various mobile applications. Given the rapid increase in availability of such data, the control of quality and accuracy constitutes a particular concern.

However, it is unclear how much data may be lost by filtering, whether the same tests should be applied across all taxonomic groups, and what is the effect of filtering for common downstream analyses. Here, we evaluate the effect of 13 recently proposed filters on the inference of species richness patterns and automated conservation assessments for 18 Neotropical taxa including animals, fungi, and plants, terrestrial and marine, downloaded from GBIF. We find that 29-90% of the records are potentially erroneous, with large variation across taxonomic groups. Tests for duplicated information, collection year, basis of record as well as urban areas and coordinates for terrestrial taxa in the sea or marine taxa on land have the greatest effect. While many flagged records might not be             de facto             erroneous, they could be overly imprecise and increase uncertainty in downstream analyses.

Throughout many grasslands and savannas in South Africa, Seriphium plumosum, an encroaching woody plant, has been rapidly displacing desirable native species. Cost-effective management techniques are required, in order to prevent encroachment. However, the effects of fire and grazing on S. plumosum are not well understood. We established a full factorial, completely randomised experiment to evaluate interactive effects of fire and livestock grazing on woody plant density and native plant diversity. Sixteen 100 m2 plots were aggregated within an area of rangeland and randomly assigned four treatments, including: i) ungrazed, not burned: ii) ungrazed, burned, iii) grazed, not burned, and iv) grazed, burned. Results indicate fire can reduce S. plumosum height (p < 0.01) and canopy cover (p < 0.01), while simultaneously maintaining the herbaceous community composition (p = 0.33).

For several groups of animals and plants, such data are available, but for fungi, especially in tropical regions like West Africa, they are mostly missing. Here, information for West African countries about species diversity of fungi and fungus-like organisms (other organisms traditionally studied by mycologists) is compiled from literature and analysed in its historical context for the first time. More than 16,000 records of fungi representing 4843 species and infraspecific taxa were found in 860 publications relating to West Africa. Records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database (2395 species), and that of the former International Mycological Institute fungal reference collection (IMI) (2526 species) were also considered. The compilation based on literature is more comprehensive than the GBIF and IMI data, although they include 914 and 679 species names, respectively, which are not present in the checklist based on literature. According to data available in literature, knowledge on fungal richness ranges from 19 species (Guinea Bissau) to 1595 (Sierra Leone). In estimating existing species diversity, richness estimators and the Hawksworth 6:1 fungus to plant species ratio were used. Based on the Hawksworth ratio, known fungal diversity in West Africa represents 11.4% of the expected diversity. For six West African countries, however, known fungal species diversity is less than 2%. Incomplete knowledge of fungal diversity is also evident by species accumulation curves not reaching saturation, by 45.3% of the fungal species in the checklist being cited only once for West Africa, and by 66.5% of the fungal species in the checklist reported only for a single country. The documentation of different systematic groups of fungi is very heterogeneous because historically investigations have been sporadic. Recent opportunistic sampling activities in Benin showed that it is not difficult to find specimens representing new country records. Investigation of fungi in West Africa started just over two centuries ago and it is still in an early pioneer phase. To promote proper exploration, the present checklist is provided as a tool to facilitate fungal identification in this region and to aid conceptualisation and justification of future research projects. Documentation of fungal diversity is urgently needed because natural habitats are being lost on a large scale through altered land use and climate change.",2020,2020-09-10 02:27:36,2021-01-24 06:44:35,,13,,1,11,,,,,,,en,,,a2237f0d-9e14-3875-8002-36e1340c9785,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1186/s43008-020-00034-y,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/W52GVXA3/Piepenbring et al. - 2020 - Mapping mycological ignorance – checklists and div.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Such trait variation may be the result of different adaptive mechanisms, including genetically-based differentiation, phenotypic plasticity or a combination of both. Disentangling the genetic and environmental components of trait variation may be particularly interesting in crop wild relatives, since they may provide unique reservoirs of genetic diversity for crop improvement. In this study, we assessed ecotypic differentiation and patterns of plasticity to drought in populations of Lupinus angustifolius L., a Mediterranean crop wild relative, from two climatically-distinct regions in the Iberian Peninsula. Using an outdoor common garden, we compared phenotypic responses of inbred maternal families to two ecologically meaningful water availability treatments (drought and high-moisture). We measured 18 different functional traits related to growth, morphology, phenology and reproduction. Plants in the drought treatment grew less, had lower leaf chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency, but also reproduced faster, produced larger seeds and altered leaflet morphology through increased leaflet thickness, higher leaflet dry matter content and lower specific leaf area. We also found significant differences between regions that likely reflect adaptation to climatically-distinct environments, with populations from the south showing a faster onset of reproduction, higher leaf thickness and higher seed size, consistent with the drier conditions experienced in southern sites. Plasticity to drought was in most cases in the same direction as quantitative genetic differentiation (i.e. cogradient variation), providing evidence of the adaptive value of the plastic change. Our results show that both genetic differentiation and plasticity can generate adaptive phenotypic variation in Lupinus angustifolius, and help to identify potentially valuable genetic resources to incorporate into breeding programs.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 06:43:25,,plaa006,,,,,,,,,,en,,,df217415-e08e-31fa-aa50-5ac4694fb67d,,Script,,10.1093/aobpla/plaa006,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/U45EK9LF/Matesanz et al. - 2020 - Plasticity to drought and ecotypic differentiation.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1093/aobpla/plaa006,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2041-2851,2041-2851,AoB PLANTS,Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-02-12,2020,Plasticity to drought and ecotypic differentiation in populations of a crop wild relative,2021-11-27T19:36:07.298100,

Focusing on the watercourses of mainland France, we aimed to identify suitable areas for A. pallipes to guide the conservation of current populations and future introduction actions or protection measures. We applied ecological niche modelling to model the potential distribution of both A. pallipes and P. leniusculus and identified locations suitable for A. pallipes only. We also assessed the potential distribution of the species under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively describing low‐warming and high‐warming conditions.

In this study we measured traits related to water-use, growth and stress tolerance in mature trees and seedlings of three oak species (Quercus alba L., Quercus falcata Michx. and Quercus palustris Münchh). which co-occur in temperate forests across the eastern USA but tend to be found in contrasting hydrologic environments.

We identified key differences between the species in both their range-wide climatic distributions (especially aridity index and mean annual temperature) and physiological traits in mature trees and seedlings, including daily water loss, hydraulic conductance, stress responses, growth rate and biomass allocation.

The genus Daucus comprises mostly herbs (therophytes, hemicryptophytes) with few rosette treelets (chamaephytes) endemic to various Macaronesian archipelagos, suggesting their independent evolution. To elucidate the evolutionary pathways to derived woodiness, we examined phylogenetic relationships and the habit and secondary xylem evolution in Daucus and related taxa. Methods Sixty taxa were surveyed for molecular markers, life history, and habit traits. Twenty‐one species were considered for wood anatomical characters. A dated phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian methods. The evolution of selected traits was reconstructed using parsimony and maximum likelihood. Results Daucus dispersed independently to the Canary Islands (and subsequently to Madeira), Cape Verde, and the Azores in the late Miocene and Pleistocene. Life span, reproductive strategy, and life form were highly homoplastic; the ancestor of Daucus was probably a monocarpic, biennial hemicryptophyte. Rosette treelets evolved independently in the Canarian‐Madeiran lineage and in Cape Verde, the latter within the last 0.13 Myr. Treelets and hemicryptophytes did not differ in wood anatomy. Pervasive axial parenchyma in wood occurred more often in polycarpic rather than monocarpic species. Conclusions Life span and life form in Daucus are evolutionarily labile and may change independently of wood anatomy, which is related to plant reproductive strategy rather than to life form. Insular woodiness may evolve rapidly (as demonstrated in D. bischoffii), and in Daucus, it does not seem to be an adaptation to lower the risk of xylem embolism.",2020,2020-05-01 06:23:08,2021-01-24 06:33:58,,394-412,,3,107,,,,,,,en,,,7fa0d465-6c8f-352a-8d61-c327368f6b68,,Script,,10.1002/ajb2.1444,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/U35SCSA7/Frankiewicz et al. - 2020 - Parallel evolution of arborescent carrots (Daucus).pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1002/ajb2.1444,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0002-9122,1537-2197",0002-9122,American Journal of Botany,Wiley,2020-03-01,2020,Parallel evolution of arborescent carrots ( Daucus ) in Macaronesia,2021-11-28T07:13:49.969152,

Despite 20 years of studies dedicated to identification of taxa that display this disjunct pattern, its origin and evolution remain an open question, especially regarding post‐isolation evolution. The blue‐ or white‐fruited dogwoods (BW) are the most species‐rich among the four major clades of Cornus L., consisting of ~35 species divided into three subgenera (subg. Yinquania, subg. Mesomora, and subg. Kraniopsis). The BW group provides an excellent example of the EA–ENA floristic disjunction for biogeographic study due to its diversity distribution centered in eastern Asia and eastern North America, yet its species relationships and delineation have remained poorly understood. In this study, we combined genome‐wide markers from RAD‐seq, morphology, fossils, and climate data to understand species relationships, biogeographic history, and ecological niche and morphological evolution. Our phylogenomic analyses with RAxML and MrBayes recovered a strongly supported and well‐resolved phylogeny of the BW group with three intercontinental disjunct clades in EA and ENA or Eurasia and North America, of which two are newly identified within subg. Kraniopsis. These analyses also recovered a potential new species but failed to resolve relationships within the C. hemsleyi–C. schindleri complex. In an effort to develop an approach to reduce computation time, analysis of different nodal age settings in treePL suggests setting a node's minimum age constraint to the lower bound of a fossil's age range to obtain similar ages to that of BEAST. Divergence time analyses with BEAST and treePL dated the BW stem back to the very Late Cretaceous and the divergence of the three subgenera in the Paleogene. By integrating fossil ages and morphology, a total evidence‐based dating approach was used in conjunction with time‐slice probabilities of dispersal under a DEC model to resolve ancestral ranges of each disjunct in the Miocene: Eurasia and ENA (disjunct 1), EA and western North America (disjunct 2), and EA (disjunct 3). The dated biogeographic history supports dispersal via the North Atlantic Land Bridge in the late Paleogene in disjunct 1 and dispersal via the Bering Land Bridge in the Miocene for disjuncts 2 and 3. Character mapping with a stochastic model in phytools and comparison of ecological niche, morphospace, and rate of evolution indicated differential divergence patterns in morphology, ecological niche, and molecules between disjunct sisters. Although morphological stasis was observed in most of the characters, evolutionary changes in growth habit and some features of leaf, flower, and fruit morphology occurred in one or both sister clades. A significant differentiation of ecological habitats in temperature, precipitation, and elevation between disjunct sisters was observed, suggesting a role of niche divergence in morphological evolution post‐isolation. The patterns of evolutionary rate between morphology and molecules varied among disjunct clades and were not always congruent between morphology and molecules, suggesting cases of non‐neutral morphological evolution driven by ecological selection. Our phylogenetic evidence and comparisons of evolutionary rate among disjunct lineages lend new insights into the formation of the diversity anomaly between EA and ENA, with particular support of an early diversification in EA. These findings, in conjunction with previous studies, again suggest that the EA–ENA disjunct floras are an assembly of lineages descended from the Mesophytic Forests that evolved from the early Paleogene “boreotropical flora” through varied evolutionary pathways across lineages.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-24 06:32:22,,604-645,,5,58,,,,,,,en,,,a6668a1e-c8cb-341e-a576-6d64ad9fc77a,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1111/jse.12676,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/MVKG5ASE/Lindelof et al. - 2020 - Phylogenomics, biogeography, and evolution of the .pdf",,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jse.12676,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1674-4918,1759-6831",1759-6831,Journal of Systematics and Evolution,Wiley,2020-09-01,2020,"Phylogenomics, biogeography, and evolution of the blue‐ or white‐fruited dogwoods (Cornus)—Insights into morphological and ecological niche divergence following intercontinental geographic isolation",2021-04-05T15:15:38.223885,

Here we developed an ecological niche model using occurrence and environmental data to infer the potential global distribution of G. turuturu. In addition, ecophysiological experiments were performed with G. turuturu populations from different climatic regions to test predictions regarding invasion risk. Our model results show high suitability in temperate and warm temperate regions around the world, with special highlight to some areas where this species still doesn’t occur. Thalli representing a potential temperate region origin, were held at 10, 13, 16, 20 and 24 °C, and measurements of optimal quantum field (Fv/Fm) demonstrated a decrease of photosynthetic yield in the higher temperature. Thalli from the population already established in warm temperate South Atlantic were held at 18, 24 and 30 °C with high and low nutrient conditions. This material exposed to the higher temperature demonstrated a drop in photosynthetic yield and significant reduction of growth rate. The congregation of modelling and physiological approach corroborate the invasive potential of G. turuturu and indicate higher invasion risk in temperate zones.

The removal of natural vegetation changes local climate, with human‐dominated land uses often warmer and drier than natural habitats. Yet, it remains an open question whether land‐use changes influence the composition of ecological assemblages in a direction consistent with the mechanism of local climatic change. Here, we used a global database of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians) to test whether human‐dominated land uses systematically favour species with distinctive realised climatic niches. We 1) explored the responses of community‐average temperature and precipitation niches to different types of land use, 2) quantified the abundances of species with distinctive climatic niches across land uses and 3) tested for differences in emergent patterns in communities from tropical versus temperate latitudes. We found that, in comparison to species from undisturbed natural habitats, the average animal found in human‐altered habitats lives in areas with higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures and higher maximum and lower minimum precipitation levels. We further found that tropical assemblages diverged more strongly than temperate assemblages between natural and human‐altered habitats, possibly because tropical species are more sensitive to climatic conditions.

While datasets provided by global aggregators are increasingly rich and useful, they suffer from varioustypes of data quality issues that can impact their usage. Using marine mammals as an example, we assessed thequality and information gaps in species distribution data from three major databases: the Global BiodiversityInformation Facility (GBIF), the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the International Union forConservation of Nature (IUCN) range maps. We analysed marine mammal records from 2015 (n= 1,396,581)and from 2019 (n = 1,904,968), for six types of common quality or usability issues. Results for both OBIS andGBIF indicate that 35 to 55% (depending on the respective database and year) of individual database's recordsare potential duplicates, fall on land, or miss a data collection date. The positional accuracy of data recordsvaries greatly due to varying precision and rounding of geographic coordinates. However, coordinate precision isspecified only in 45% and 70% of records in GBIF and OBIS, respectively. In 2019, only approximately 70% ofGBIF and OBIS records are encoded using more than three decimals (i.e. remaining records have a positionalaccuracy lower than 100 m). We also quantified that only 19% (n= 135,885) and 11% (n= 133,882) of therecords in 2015 and 2019, respectively, were common to OBIS and GBIF. Despite the continuous increase in thenumber of records in both databases, the number of shared records slightly decreased. It is therefore likely thatnew records added to GBIF and OBIS between 2015 and 2019 come from different data providers. Finally, toidentify potential information gaps in marine mammal distributions, we overlaid IUCN range maps and speciesoccurrences from global databases.

In this sense, not only species richness per se, but also community composition, including the distribution range of the species, should be considered. The latter is especially relevant in the current context of biotic homogenization, where the presence of geographically widely distributed species is increasingly frequent in detriment of native species. By studying plant species of the herbaceous stratum of cacao production systems, we can evaluate, at a narrow local scale (>10 ha), the potential role of agroforestry systems and management intensity in diversity conservation and against biotic homogenization. This study was performed in an experimental trial in Bolivia, where five production systems representing a gradient of management intensity were compared: two monocultures and two agroforestry systems under conventional and organic farming containing a planted cover crop layer, and a complex successional agroforestry system with no external inputs. All species in the herbaceous stratum were identified and classified according to their geographical range. An indicator species analysis was implemented to identify species linked to a specific production system. In total, 171 species were recorded, 42% of which were strictly herbaceous while the rest of them were woody regrowths, mainly found in the successional agroforestry system (an average of 40 species compared to 16 species in the other systems). Total species richness was higher in the successional agroforestry system compared with the other production systems. No main differences were found between the other systems, that is, monocultures and conventionally managed systems did not have less species than agroforestry and organically managed systems. However, community composition did change following the management intensity gradient. In addition, we found that widely distributed species, including some exotic species, were associated to intensive management, i.e. monocultures and conventional systems with high solar exposure levels and/or glyphosate application. Conversely, successional agroforestry and organic systems harbored species with a geographical distribution range restricted to the Neotropics or South America. According to our results, promotion and support for the adoption of cocoa organic and agroforestry systems, as a counterbalance to the common intensively managed plantations, could contribute to both biodiversity conservation and the minimization of biotic homogenization.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 06:24:37,,106664,,,287,,,,,,,en,,,be2f5be8-348f-33c6-9d11-effb133c8b52,,Script,,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106664,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/WGZSJE3C/Marconi and Armengot - 2020 - Complex agroforestry systems against biotic homoge.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106664,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0167-8809,0167-8809,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",Elsevier BV,2020-01-01,2020,Complex agroforestry systems against biotic homogenization: The case of plants in the herbaceous stratum of cocoa production systems,2021-01-15T04:49:28.796188,

We predicted the future of plant species and communities on the unique páramo sky islands by implementing the Spatial Explicit Species Assemblage Modelling framework. Specifically we: (a) calculated species’ maximum dispersal distance; (b) modelled species’ present and future distributions up to 2100; and (c) assembled models into plant communities. The final vulnerability assessment was based on a multi‐dimensional evaluation that considered the species, local plant community and sky island levels. Location Ecuadorian super‐páramo (>4,200 m). Methods Using species trait data, the maximum dispersal distance of 435 species was calculated. Species distribution models (SDM) were fitted to obtain current and future distribution predictions based on dispersal and bioclimatic factors. The final current assemblages and those for 2100 were achieved by stacking all probabilistic SDMs and applying the probability ranking rule. The vulnerability of each sky island was evaluated by quantifying richness and composition changes. Results Maximum dispersal distances ranged between 0.008 m/year and 6,027 m/year, and across all scenarios, 70% of models showed a net loss in species distribution, while 9% of all species were predicted to undergo extinction in Ecuador by 2100. Local richness was estimated to decrease by 56.63% on average, and compositional changes in each sky island suggested a mean loss of 64.74% of their original species pool against a 12.97% gain. Finally, 5% of the sky island floras reconverted from high‐elevation to low‐elevation species. These numbers were usually more important for high‐elevation species and the mountains Pichincha, Ilinizas and Antisana. Conclusions This methodological pioneer study provides novel insight into the future of páramo biodiversity. Significant losses in species distribution and changes in community richness and composition suggest drastic impacts and call for further research considering additional factors, such as land use.

Global models help us to understand the consequences of environmental changes for biodiversity, but tend to neglect important geographical variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. Here we test whether biodiversity responses to climate change and land-use change differ among biomes (geographical units that have marked differences in environment and species composition). We find the strongest negative responses to both pressures in tropical biomes and in the Mediterranean. A further analysis points towards similar underlying drivers for the sensitivity to each pressure: we find both greater reductions in species richness in the types of land use most disturbed by humans and more negative predicted responses to climate change in areas of lower climatic seasonality, and in areas where a greater proportion of species are near their upper temperature limit. Within the land most modified by humans, reductions in biodiversity were particularly large in regions where humans have come to dominate the land more recently. Our results will help to improve predictions of how biodiversity is likely to change with ongoing climatic and land-use changes, pointing toward particularly large declines in the tropics where much future agricultural expansion is expected to occur.

We examined the potential influence of the mean and seasonal climate variables on the distribution of species. Presence‐only occurrence records of species, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5), and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species’ distribution models using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Our results suggested that overall, 11 of the 13 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space (regions where climate conditions will be similar to those of area currently occupied) at the continental scale, but American marten Martes americana and ‘woodland’ caribou Rangifer tarandus are likely to lose suitable climate range by 2070.

Farmers’ traditional varieties (“landraces”) are major sources of genetic variation. The degree of representation of crop landrace diversity in ex situ conservation is poorly understood, partly due to a lack of methods that can negotiate both the anthropogenic and environmental determinants of their geographic distributions. Here, we describe a novel spatial modelling and ex situ conservation gap analysis modelling framework for crop landraces, using common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as a case study. Location The Americas. Methods The modelling framework includes five main steps: (a) determining relevant landrace groups using literature to develop and test classification models; (b) modelling the potential geographic distributions of these groups using occurrence (landrace presences) combined with environmental and socioeconomic predictor data; (c) calculating geographic and environmental gap scores for current genebank collections; (d) mapping ex situ conservation gaps; and (e) compiling expert inputs. Results Modelled distributions and conservation gaps for the two genepools of common bean (Andean and Mesoamerican) were robustly predicted and align well with expert opinions. Both genepools are relatively well conserved, with Andean ex situ collections representing 78.5% and Mesoamerican 98.2% of their predicted geographic distributions. Modelling revealed additional collection priorities for Andean landraces occur primarily in Chile, Peru, Colombia and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. Mesoamerican landrace collecting priorities are concentrated in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala.

Although these taxa have been widely reported, their occurrence in the Palaeogene of Myanmar remains poorly documented. Here we report on the morphology of PPL pollen along a middle to upper Eocene sedimentary sequence in central Myanmar and discuss their nearest living relatives (NLRs). Principal components analysis (PCA) indicates that Palmaepollenites kutchensis, Dicolpopollis and Longapertites were dispersed from freshwater plants, whereas the parent taxon of Proxapertites operculatus was probably a member of the coastal vegetation in the manner of Spinizonocolpites. This, with sedimentological data, suggests a palaeoenvironmental change from a brackish, tidally influenced environment to a fully freshwater setting through the late Eocene. Additionally, we mapped and compared the geographical distribution of selected Eocene palm taxa and their NLRs, and found that their distributions shrank after the Eocene. Moreover, in the Palaeogene, species diversity of selected PPL taxa seems lower in Myanmar than in the Indian subcontinent and other regions in South-East Asia. We hypothesize that in the Eocene the Indo–Asian collision zone formed a ‘hotspot’ for palm diversity, which is reflected in species-rich palynofloras. However, the local palm diversity declined after the Eocene, whereas, at the global level, palm distribution was distinctly reduced between the Eocene and the present. We propose that the retreat of the palms may have occurred as early as the Eocene – Oligocene Transition (EOT), but this remains to be confirmed by the study of EOT pollen records in tropical regions.",2020,2020-09-10 02:27:36,2021-01-24 07:30:33,,boaa038,,,,,,,,,,en,,,626564bf-c9e7-3bdb-b903-d5305cb79a3c,,Script,,10.1093/botlinnean/boaa038,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/3MA6UZ3G/Huang et al. - 2020 - Eocene palms from central Myanmar in a South-East .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1093/botlinnean/boaa038,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0024-4074,1095-8339",0024-4074,Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society,Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-07-15,2020,Eocene palms from central Myanmar in a South-East Asian and global perspective: evidence from the palynological record,2021-11-14T06:09:59.905454,

In this study, we examined historical occurrences of ten common mangrove species and quantified the rate of latitudinal shift as a possible response to climate change. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) was used to gather occurrence of mangrove species. We found that nine of ten species have been shifting poleward since the 1950s. Overall mean latitudinal shift rates of mangrove species were significantly higher in Australia than in North America (1.7 and 1.3 latitude degrees per decade, respectively). In Australia, mean temperature and precipitation of localities decreased as mangrove species shifted towards drier regions at higher latitudes. However, in North America and West Africa, mean temperature of localities seems relatively stable, whereas precipitation slightly decreased. We provide new quantitative information on shifts in occurrence of common mangrove species worldwide under a changing climate. We confirm the poleward movement of mangrove species over the past 70 years and suggest that local mean temperature and precipitation can act as key drivers of mangrove range shifts.

Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns of antiinfective compounds from seed plants in one of the most species-rich regions on Earth and identify clades with naturally occurring substances potentially suitable for the development of new pharmaceutical compounds. Specifically, we combine taxonomic and phylogenetic data for >7,500 seed plant species from the flora of Java with >16,500 secondary metabolites and 6,255 georeferenced occurrence records to 1) identify clades in the phylogeny that are characterized by either an overrepresentation (“hot clades”) or an underrepresentation (“cold clades”) of antiinfective compounds and 2) assess the spatial patterns of plants with antiinfective compounds relative to total plant diversity across the region. Across the flora of Java, we identify 26 “hot clades” with plant species providing a high probability of finding antibiotic constituents. In addition, 24 “cold clades” constitute lineages with low numbers of reported activities but which have the potential to yield novel compounds. Spatial patterns of plant species and metabolite diversity are strongly correlated across Java, indicating that regions of highest species diversity afford the highest potential to discover novel natural products.

Such a question has long remained controversial because various approaches applied in the past have drawn conflicting images of early angiosperm ecology. Methods We provided a new perspective on the question by using support vector machines to model the environmental niche of 51 species belonging to ten genera of extant lineages that diverged early during angiosperm evolution (basal angiosperms). Then, we analysed the resulting pattern of niche overlap and determined whether this pattern deviates from what would be expected on the basis of a null model or whether it might mirror a legacy of a common primitive niche based on a phylogenetic reconstruction. Key Results The niche of three-quarters of the species and all genera converged towards tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs). The latitudinal pattern of basal angiosperm richness indeed culminated in the tropics, and the elevational pattern revealed a humpback curve peaking between 2000 m and 3500 m when accounting for the effect of area. At first glance, this diversity pattern does not significantly differ from null predictions. However, we revealed a tendency for the basal-most taxa to occur in TMCFs so that phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that the niche of the common ancestor of the sampled basal angiosperms had a probability of 0.85–0.93 to overlap with TMCFs. Conclusions Our new approach indicates that the environmental convergence of extant basal angiosperms towards TMCFs would reflect a legacy of an ancestral niche from which the least basal taxa would have diverged following a random pattern under geometric constraints.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 07:25:05,,49-57,,1,125,,,,,,,en,,,812b76b2-c21c-3d10-a260-fa6c6073f0a3,,Script,,10.1093/aob/mcz131,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/PMUJZ2JT/Pouteau - Supplementary Information.doc; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/M6CK5PR6/Pouteau et al. - 2020 - Retracing the contours of the early angiosperm env.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1093/aob/mcz131,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0305-7364,1095-8290",0305-7364,Annals of Botany,Oxford University Press (OUP),2019-08-12,2019,Retracing the contours of the early angiosperm environmental niche,2021-12-09T16:46:45.899662,

However, the global distribution, endemicity, and latitudinal gradients of species richness in mangrove crabs remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether species richness of mangrove crabs decreases towards the higher latitudes and tested the importance of environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in creating the latitudinal gradients in species richness of mangrove crabs. A total of 8262 distribution records of 481 species belonging to six families of mangrove crabs including Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae were extracted from open-access databases or collected by the authors, quality controlled, cleaned, and analyzed. Species richness was plotted against 5° latitudinal bands in relation to environmental factors. The R software and ArcGIS 10.6.1 were used to analyze the species latitudinal range and richness as well as to map the distribution of mangrove forest, endemic species, species geographical distribution records, and biogeographic regions. The Indo-West Pacific showed the highest species richness of mangrove crabs where more than 65% of species were found in the Indian Ocean and along the western Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that there are 11 significantly different biogeographic regions of mangrove crabs. The highest endemicity rate was observed in the NW Pacific Ocean (29%). Latitudinal patterns of species richness in Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, and Sesarmidae showed an increasing trend from the poles toward the intermediate latitudes including one dip near the equator. However, latitudinal gradients in Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, and Oziidae were unimodal increasing from the higher latitudes towards the equator. Species richness per 5° latitudinal bands significantly increased following mean SST mean (°C), calcite, euphotic depth (m), and mangrove area (km2) across all latitudes, and tide average within each hemisphere. Species richness significantly decreased with dissolved O2 (ml l−1) and nitrate (μmol l−1) over all latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. The climax of global latitudinal species richness for some mangrove was observed along latitudes 20° N and 15°–25° S, not at the equator. This can suggest that temperature is probably the key driver of latitudinal gradients of mangrove crabs’ species richness.

Such changes may influence marine ectotherms, such as sharks, as their body temperature concurrently increases toward their upper thermal limits. Sharks are high trophic level predators that play a key role in the regulation of ecosystem structure and health. Because many sharks are already threatened, it is especially important to understand the impact of climate change on these species. We used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to predict changes in future (2050–2099) relative to current (1956–2005) habitat suitability for pelagic sharks based on an ensemble of climate models and emission scenarios. Our predictive models indicate that future sea temperatures are likely to shift the location of suitable shark habitat within the Australian EEZ. On average, suitable habitat is predicted to decrease within the EEZ for requiem and increase for mackerel sharks, however, the direction and severity of change was highly influenced by the choice of climate model.

They vary in frequency, from very abundant (D. sandwichianum) to rare and critically endangered (D. molokaiense).

Here, we evaluate potential shortfalls for flowering plants in a tropical hotspot, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, by cross‐referencing two online repositories of biodiversity data (the Global Biodiversity Information Facility – GBIF – and the Brazilian Flora 2020 floristic database – BFG). We aimed to evaluate the congruence between those repositories, highlighting tendencies in current documentation for this area. We found that from the 7220 reported flowering plant species endemics to the Atlantic Forest, 1573 (22%) have no valid spatial data in GBIF, and 75% of all of the 605,951 records do not present valid spatial information. Most of the missing information is related to species known only from few and old collections with absent or inaccurately georeferenced data.

Currently, N. simulans in soybean is predominantly found in Argentina, but future changes in the distribution from both dispersal and range shifts due to climate change may affect soybean cultivation in southern South America. We developed a species distribution model to examine the distribution range of N. simulans. We compared the potential distribution of N. simulans under current and future projected climatic conditions in order to identify future areas of natural occurrence with ecological niche models using Maxent. Current records of N. simulans show that while the species is present in Argentina, and some areas of Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, our models suggest that many new suitable areas will be available for N. simulans under climate change including other regions of Argentina, and southern Chile. Our results also predict potential future range shifts and distributions into Bolivia, but not Peru nor Brazil. In our model, seasonal trends in temperature were shown to have the greatest contribution to the potential distribution, whereas isothermality (i.e., temperature variability) was correlated to potential future distribution ranges. We conclude that current populations of N. simulans may be expanding its distribution range by diffusion (i.e., range expansion over generations at the margins of populations), and regions with potential future N. simulans distribution should be closely monitored.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 07:11:21,,toaa089,,,,,,,,,,en,,,ca539131-17db-3572-8664-ef037d1dff3f,,Script,,10.1093/jee/toaa089,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/YRS8LTNR/de Paula and Barreto - 2020 - Potential Distribution of Nysius simulans (Hemipte.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1093/jee/toaa089,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0022-0493,1938-291X",0022-0493,Journal of Economic Entomology,Oxford University Press (OUP),2020-05-14,2020,Potential Distribution of Nysius simulans (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) in Soybean Crops in South America Under Current and Future Climate,2021-01-17T04:51:59.980232,

Here we study the evolution of life‐cycle strategies in the grass subfamily Pooideae and test if transitions between them are facilitated by evolutionary precursors. We integrate ecological, life‐cycle strategy and growth data in a phylogenetic framework. We investigate if growth traits are candidates for a precursor. Species in certain Pooideae clades are predisposed to evolve annuality from perenniality, potentially due to the shared inheritance of specific evolutionary precursors. Seasonal dry climates, which have been linked to annuality, were only able to select for transitions to annuality when the precursor was present. Allocation of more resources to above‐ground rather than below‐ground growth is a candidate for the precursor.

However, theory suggests that a species’ tolerance to competition is reduced in harsh environments, such as at the extremes of its climatic niche. This implies that under certain conditions, interspecific competition near species’ range margins can prevent the establishment of populations into otherwise tolerable environments and results in geographic distributions being shaped by the interaction of climate and competition. We test this prediction by challenging an experimentally-parameterized mechanistic competition model to predict the poleward range boundaries of two widely co-occurring and ecologically-similar aquatic duckweed plants. We show that simple, mechanistic ecological niche models which include competition and thermal response terms best predict the northern range limits of our study species, outperforming competition-free mechanistic models and matching the predictive ability of popular statistical niche models fit to occurrence records. Next, using the theoretical framework of modern coexistence theory, we show that relative nonlinearity in competitors’ responses to temperature fluctuations maintains coexistence at the subordinate competitor’s poleward range boundary, highlighting the importance of this underappreciated fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanism. Our results demonstrate the predictive utility of mechanistic niche models and support a more nuanced, interactive role of climate and species interactions in determining range boundaries, which may help explain the conflicting results from previous tests of classic range limit theory and contribute to a more mechanistic understanding of range dynamics under global change.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 07:07:10,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,c3845492-4728-3782-bb0f-21d90d68d65d,,Script,,10.1101/2020.02.24.946574,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/RFQ7A6JA/Armitage and Jones - 2020 - Barriers to coexistence limit the poleward range o.pdf; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/GF2QKGRA/Armitage - Supplementary Information.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1101/2020.02.24.946574,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,posted-content,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,2020-02-25,2020,Barriers to coexistence limit the poleward range of a globally-distributed plant,2021-01-14T07:19:59.984141,

We investigated how niche changes affected reciprocal transferability of ecological niche models (ENMs) calibrated using data from the species’ native and Philippine-invaded ranges, and both ranges combined.

We sampled putative L. ferocissimum (i.e. tentatively identified morphologically in the field) across its native range in South Africa and introduced range in Australia. Morphometric and genetic analyses were conducted to confirm the species identity of these samples, and to assess morphological and genetic variation across both ranges. All samples collected in Australia were confirmed as L. ferocissimum, with no evidence of hybridisation with any other Lycium species. Nuclear and chloroplast genetic diversity within L. ferocissimum across both South Africa and Australia was low, with no evidence of genetic structure. One of the two common chloroplast haplotypes found across Australia was found at only two sites in South Africa, both near Cape Town, suggesting that the Australian lineage may have originated from this region. Ten samples from South Africa putatively identified in the field as L. ferocissimum were genetically characterised as different (unidentified) Lycium species.

CPs exhibit highly specialised and often very sensitive ecologies, being generally restricted to nutrient-impoverished habitats where carnivory offers a competitive advantage. As such, they are often the first species to disappear following habitat degradation, land use change, and alteration to natural ecological processes, and are at significant risk from processes such as eutrophication and weed invasion, and even poorly-understood impacts such as airborne nitrogen inputs. Many of the world’s 860 species of CPs are found in wetland habitats, which represent some of the most cleared and heavily degraded ecosystems on Earth. Global diversity hotspots for CPs are likewise located in some of the most heavily cleared and disturbed areas of the planet—southwestern Western Australia, Southeast Asia, Mediterranean Europe, central eastern Brazil, and the southeastern United States—placing their conservation at odds with human developmental interests. Many carnivorous plant species exhibit extreme range-restriction and are wholly localised to specific geological formations, microhabitats or elevations, with nowhere to move to in the face of environmental change such as a warming, drying climate. We provide the first systematic examination of the conservation status and threats to all CPs globally, compiling full or partial assessments of conservation status category for 860 species from 18 genera, and provide ten recommendations towards better conservation and management of this iconic group. A total of 69 species were assessed as Critically Endangered (8% of all species), 47 as Endangered (6%), 104 as Vulnerable (12%), and 23 as Near Threatened (3%). Slightly over 60% of CPs (521 species) were assessed as Least Concern. At least 89 species are known from only a single location based on current knowledge. Data on threatening processes were available for 790 species, with the most common threatening processes including Agriculture and Aquaculture (impacting 170 species), Natural Systems Modifications (168 species), Climate Change and Severe Weather (158 species), Energy Production and Mining (127 species), Human Intrusions and Disturbance (126 species), and Biological Resource Use (98 species). Almost a quarter of all species were impacted upon by three or more threatening processes. The most significant threats placing species at imminent risk of extinction include the continuing clearing of natural habitat for urban and agricultural development and the illegal collection of individuals from the wild for horticultural trade. The complex and specialised ecological requirements of CPs, together with the multifaceted threats they face, make conservation difficult and repatriation even to restored areas challenging. As the number of vulnerable, endangered and extinct carnivorous plant species continues to grow, despite significant conservation efforts in many regions and greater awareness of their ecological requirements, it is clear that a paradigm shift is required in our approach to the preservation of this unique group of plants in order to achieve long-term conservation successes.",2020,2020-10-12 02:07:02,2021-01-24 08:01:04,,e01272,,,,,,,,,,en,,,8577b037-9a7b-34f2-9c8c-c35eca2d2131,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01272,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/WCFVFYP8/Cross et al. - 2020 - Conservation of carnivorous plants in the age of e.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01272,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2351-9894,2351-9894,Global Ecology and Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-12-01,2020,Conservation of carnivorous plants in the age of extinction,2021-08-16T14:37:08.865790,

In this sense, identifying potential invaders before they are introduced and analyzing the ecological implications of possible escapes of captive species to the wild is an important issue for preventing invasive species impacts. In Brazil, several studies have demonstrated the consequences of wildlife trade on the biogeographic patterns of some species. In this context, using the ten most seized bird species in Brazil, we seek to identify the most suitable areas for invasion of these species in all Brazilian regions, as well as in other South American countries. To this end, we used ecological niche modeling to evaluate region invasibility by the ten assessed species. In addition, natural distribution polygons and actual records were used to evaluate changes in the distribution ranges of the evaluated species. Overall, ‘Red-cowled Cardinal’, ‘Saffron Finch’, ‘Yellow-bellied Seedeater’ and ‘Rufous-collared Sparrow’ reached the highest rate of invasion in susceptible areas. Proportionally, French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname showed the highest amount of invasion potential areas in South America overall. Ecuador and Bolivia reached the highest percentage of suitable areas for four or more species. Regarding Brazil, all regions were suitable for invasion by at least three of the ten analyzed species, whereas the north and midwest were the most vulnerable regions.

A prerequisite for fulfilling this purpose is to be able to identify the species and communities that make up that biodiversity. We tested a set of varied methods for inventory and monitoring of plants, birds and terrestrial invertebrates on a grid of 40 sites in a 938 ha study area in the Slikok Creek watershed, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We sampled plants and lichens through observation and specimen-based methods. We surveyed birds using bird call surveys on variable circular plots. We sampled terrestrial arthropods by sweep net sampling, processing samples with High Throughput Sequencing methods. We surveyed for earthworms, using the hot mustard extraction method and identified worm specimens by morphology and DNA barcoding. We examined community membership using clustering methods and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling.

We propose that combined assessment of evolutionary convergence of plant functional traits and phylogenetic biome conservatism provides a useful approach for characterizing biomes. We focus on the little‐known succulent biome, a trans‐continentally distributed assemblage of succulent‐rich, drought‐deciduous, fire‐free forest, thicket and scrub vegetation as a useful exemplar biome to gain insights into these questions. Location Global lowland (sub)tropics. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Angiosperms. Methods We use a model ensemble approach to model the distribution of 884 species of stem succulents, a plant functional group representing a striking example of evolutionary convergence. Using this model, phylogenies, and species occurrence data, we quantify phylogenetic succulent biome conservatism for 10 non‐succulent trans‐continental plant clades including prominent elements of the succulent biome, representing over 800 species. Results The geographical and climatic distributions of stem succulents provide an objective and quantitative proxy for mapping the distribution of the succulent biome. High fractions of succulent biome occupancy across continents suggest all 10 non‐succulent study clades are phylogenetically conserved within the succulent biome. Main conclusions The trans‐continental succulent and savanna biomes both show evolutionary convergence in key biome‐related plant functional traits. However, in contrast to the savanna biome, which was apparently assembled via repeated local recruitment of lineages via biome shifts from adjacent biomes within continents, the succulent biome forms a coherent trans‐continental evolutionary arena for drought‐adapted tropical biome conserved lineages. Recognizing the important functional differences between the succulent‐rich, grass‐poor, fire‐free succulent biome and the grass‐dominated, succulent‐poor, fire‐prone savanna biome, and defining them as distinct seasonally dry tropical biomes, occupying essentially non‐overlapping distributions, provides critical insights into tropical biodiversity and the extent of biome stasis versus biome shifting.",2020,2020-05-01 06:23:23,2021-01-24 07:57:25,,geb.13089,,,,,,,,,,en,,,f59c6ed2-1f25-398a-80bc-4dea4506c914,,Script,,10.1111/geb.13089,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/S3TWQGAZ/Ringelberg - Supplementary Information.docx; /Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/95GSRX6G/Ringelberg et al. - 2020 - Biomes as evolutionary arenas Convergence and con.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/geb.13089,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"1466-822X,1466-8238",1466-822X,Global Ecology and Biogeography,Wiley,2020-03-10,2020,Biomes as evolutionary arenas: Convergence and conservatism in the trans‐continental succulent biome,2021-02-24T01:53:28.061876,

Species distribution models are geospatial tools widely used in the identification and delineation of species’ distribution areas and zones susceptible to climate change. The objectives of this study were to: (i) model and quantify the environmentally suitable area for Pinus greggii in Mexico, and possible future distributions under four different scenarios of climate change; (ii) identify the most relevant environmental variables that will possibly drive changes in future distribution; and (iii) to propose adequate zones for the species’ conservation in Mexico. Some 438 records of Pinus greggii from several national and international databases were obtained, and duplicates were discarded to avoid overestimations in the models. Climatic, edaphic, and topographic variables were used and 100 distribution models for current and future scenarios were generated using the Maxent software. The best model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and 0.93 for model training and validation, respectively, a partial ROC of 1.94, and a significant Z test (p<0.01). The current estimated suitable area of Pinus greggii in Mexico was 617.706.04 ha. The most relevant environmental variables for current distribution were annual mean temperature, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and slope. For the 2041-2060 models, annual mean temperature, precipitation of coldest quarter, and slope were the most important drivers. The use of climatic models allowed to predict a future decrease in suitable habitat for the species by 2041-2060, ranging from 48.403.85 (7.8% - HadGEM2-ES RCP 8.5 model) to 134.680.17 ha (21.8% - CNRM-CM5 RCP 4.5).

This includes 25 outgroups and 133 araneid ingroups representing the subfamilies Zygiellinae Simon, 1929, Nephilinae Simon, 1894, and the typical araneids, here informally named the “ARA Clade”. The araneid genera analysed here include roughly 90% of all currently named araneid species. The ARA Clade is the primary focus of this analysis. In taxonomic terms, outgroups comprise 22 genera and 11 families, and the ingroup comprises three Zygiellinae and four Nephilinae genera, and 85 ARA Clade genera (ten new). Within the ARA Clade, we recognize ten informal groups that contain at least three genera each and are supported under Bayesian posterior probabilities (≥ 0.95): “Caerostrines” (Caerostris, Gnolus and Testudinaria), “Micrathenines” (Acacesia, Micrathena, Ocrepeira, Scoloderus and Verrucosa), “Eriophorines” (Acanthepeira, Alpaida, Eriophora, Parawixia and Wagneriana), “Backobourkiines” (Acroaspis, Backobourkia, Carepalxis, Novakiella, Parawixia, Plebs, Singa and three new genera), “Argiopines” (Arachnura, Acusilas, Argiope, Cyrtophora, Gea, Lariniaria and Mecynogea), “Cyrtarachnines” (Aranoethra, Cyrtarachne, Paraplectana, Pasilobus and Poecilopachys), “Mastophorines” (Celaenia, Exechocentrus and Mastophora,), “Nuctenines” (Larinia, Larinioides and Nuctenea), “Zealaraneines” (Colaranea, Cryptaranea, Paralarinia, Zealaranea and two new genera) and “Gasteracanthines” (Augusta, Acrosomoides, Austracantha, Gasteracantha, Isoxya, Macracantha, Madacantha, Parmatergus and Thelacantha). Few of these groups are currently corroborated by morphology, behaviour, natural history or biogeography.

Araneus, Argiope, Eriophora and Larinia are polyphyletic, Araneus implying nine new taxa of genus rank, and Eriophora and Larinia two each. In Araneus and Eriophora, polyphyly was usually due to north temperate generic concepts being used as dumping grounds for species from southern hemisphere regions, e.g. South‐East Asia, Australia or New Zealand. Although Araneidae is one of the better studied spider families, too little natural history and/or morphological data are available across these terminals to draw any strong evolutionary conclusions. However, the classical orb web is reconstructed as plesiomorphic for Araneidae, with a single loss in “cyrtarachnines”–“mastophorines”. Web decorations (collectively known as stabilimenta) evolved perhaps five times.

This study aimed to assess geographic distribution of genetic variation of this species across its distribution range, identify the factors influencing its genetic structure and use this information to suggest conservation and management strategies in its native and introduced ranges, respectively. Methods We assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of 348 individuals from 31 populations across its native (Asia) and introduced (USA) ranges for 15 nuclear microsatellite loci. The spatial pattern of genetic variation was investigated at both large and regional spatial scales with the hypothesis that geographic distance and natural geographic barriers would influence the population structure with varying levels of differentiation across spatial scales. Important Findings We found relatively high genetic diversity at the population level and pronounced genetic differentiation in P. indica, as compared with the genetic diversity parameters of mangroves and mangrove associates in this region. Most of the populations showed heterozygote deficiency, primarily due to inbreeding and impediment of gene flow. Analysis of population structures at large spatial scale revealed the presence of two major clusters across the species’ natural range separating populations in China from those in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Philippines, and that the USA population might have been introduced from the population cluster in China. Genetic differentiation between populations was also observed at the regional scale.

In this study, the first such synthesis of a flora from such a large and diverse part of the world is attempted, all seed plants from the North American continent (here defined to include Canada, United States, and Mexico), with a focus on examining phylogenetic diversity and endemism.

The goal of this research is to determine the habitat factors lead to the mass occurrence of C. flavescens and the present situation of that species and its habitat in Central Europe. Soil conditions of the three populations were studied. To determine the correlation between the occurrence and abundance of species and the chemical parameters of the soil, the DCA and CCA methods were used. The DCA of environmental Ellenberg values was made for all relevés known from Poland. The occurrence of C. flavescens in plant communities in Central Europe was studied. The maximum entropy method was used for potential distribution analysis of C. flavescens. All analyzed traits are important for this species and none has an advantage over another, so the environmental factor affecting the occurrence of C. flavescens is different from the tested. Analysis on Ellenberg values indicate that the longest gradients are temperature, moisture and nutrients. The analysis of vegetation data involving Cyperus flavescens available from Central Europe indicates that this species occurs mainly in the company of Juncus bufonius and Plantago intermedia, whereas other species of the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class appear rarely. In MaxEnt analysis based on bioclimatic variables, the most important variable is BIO1 (Annual Mean Temperature). The results of our observation indicate that anthropogenic factors such as grazing livestock have a positive effect on the occurrence of the species. It is also very likely that the species is promoted by very warm summers with only short periods of heavy rains.

Though controversial, the savanna hypothesis continues to motivate research into the palaeo-environments of Africa. Reconstruction of these ancient environments has depended heavily on carbon isotopic analysis of fossil bones and palaeosols. The sparsity of the fossil record, however, imposes a limit to the strength of inference that can be drawn from such data. Time-calibrated phylogenies offer an additional tool for dating the spread of savanna habitat. Here, using the evolutionary ages of African savanna trees, we suggest an initial tropical or subtropical expansion of savanna between 10 and 15 Ma, which then extended to higher latitudes, reaching southern Africa ca. 3 Ma. Our phylogenetic estimates of the origin and latitudinal spread of savannas broadly correspond with isotopic age estimates and encompass the entire hominin fossil record. Our results are consistent with the savanna hypothesis of early hominin evolution and reignite the debate on the drivers of savanna expansion.

Climate change could impact the distribution and diversity of tree ferns, hence impacting the ecological processes provided by them. We investigate the impacts of future climate changes in the potential distribution of tree fern species, as well as in the α- and β-diversity. Our first hypothesis (H             1             ) is that warmer climate in the future will increase the distribution of Cyatheaceae species and decrease the distribution of Dicksoniaceae species. Due to a larger number of Cyatheaceae than Dicksoniaceae, the richness will tend to increase. However, the increase in richness might lead to homogenization, consequently decreasing β-diversity (H             2             ). To test these hypotheses, we used distribution models to predict the potential species distribution in the present and future. Then, we calculated the changes in potential distribution areas, α-, and β-diversity components between scenarios. Finally, we assessed the impact of these changes within Protected Areas. We found that Dicksoniaceae distribution tends to shrink in the future, while half of Cyatheaceae tend to lose distribution. Species richness tends to decrease in the future, as well as β-diversity. At least 43% of the sites tend to have their species richness reduced, while only 26% of sites tend to gain species.

Quercus leucotrichophora (A. Camus) (Banj oak) is a keystone tree in moist temperate forests of Central Himalayas. Banj oak forests have high biodiversity, soil organic matter, and water holding capacity that supports human well-being. Climate variability coupled with anthropogenic pressure has affected the regeneration and succession patterns in these forests. Conservation of Banj oak is a socio-ecological challenge and will require an interdisciplinary approach. In the present study, we have assessed the impact of climate variability on the ecological niche of Q. leucotrichophora using the Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt). The occurrence locations of the tree species were obtained from primary survey and published works (1984 to 2018). CMIP5 (Couple Model Inter-comparison Project)-derived bioclimatic variables were used as predictor variables in the modeling. The predictions were done following four IPCC RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios for the future periods of 2050 and 2070. Our results show that the estimated potential habitats of the Q. leucotrichophora are likely to decline by 84–99%. Shift of the species from its present habitats due to climate variability reflects unusual patterns and demands climate adaptive management for forest landscape restoration (FLR) through active community involvement in the region.

Yet, detailed knowledge of the spatial footprints of these threats is lacking, including where they overlap and how they change over time. These knowledge gaps are real barriers for effective conservation planning. Here, we develop a novel approach to reconstruct the individual and combined footprints of both threats over time. We combine satellite‐based land‐cover change maps, habitat suitability models and hunting pressure models to demonstrate our approach for the community of larger mammals (48 species > 1 kg) across the 1.1 million km2 Gran Chaco region, a global deforestation hotspot covering parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. This provides three key insights. First, we find that the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting pressure expanded considerably between 1985 and 2015, across ~40% of the entire Chaco – twice the area affected by deforestation. Second, both threats increasingly acted together within the ranges of larger mammals in the Chaco (17% increase on average, ± 20% SD, cumulative increase of co‐occurring threats across 465 000 km2), suggesting large synergistic effects. Conversely, core areas of high‐quality habitats declined on average by 38%. Third, we identified remaining priority areas for conservation in the northern and central Chaco, many of which are outside the protected area network. We also identify hotspots of high threat impacts in central Paraguay and northern Argentina, providing a spatial template for threat‐specific conservation action. Overall, our findings suggest increasing synergistic effects between habitat destruction and hunting pressure in the Chaco, a situation likely common in many tropical deforestation frontiers.

Such c a × climate interactions importantly drive CO2 fertilization effects of tropical forests predicted by global vegetation models, but have not been tested empirically. Here we use tree‐ring analyses to quantify how c a rise has shifted the sensitivity of tree stem growth to annual fluctuations in rainfall and temperature. We hypothesized that c a rise reduces drought sensitivity and increases temperature sensitivity of growth, by reducing transpiration and increasing leaf temperature. These responses were expected for cooler sites. At warmer sites, c a rise may cause leaf temperatures to frequently exceed the optimum for photosynthesis, and thus induce increased drought sensitivity and stronger negative effects of temperature. We tested these hypotheses using measurements of 5,318 annual rings from 129 trees of the widely distributed (sub‐)tropical tree species, Toona ciliata . We studied growth responses during 1950–2014, a period during which c a rose by 28%. Tree‐ring data were obtained from two cooler (mean annual temperature: 20.5–20.7°C) and two warmer (23.5–24.8°C) sites. We tested c a × climate interactions, using mixed‐effect models of ring‐width measurements. Our statistical models revealed several significant and robust c a × climate interactions. At cooler sites (and seasons), c a × climate interactions showed good agreement with hypothesized growth responses of reduced drought sensitivity and increased temperature sensitivity. At warmer sites, drought sensitivity increased with increasing c a, as predicted, and hot years caused stronger growth reduction at high c a.

Are such data sets appropriate to describe composition gradients and β-diversity? When compared with phytosociological data, what are the differences in terms of composition (co-occurrence) gradients depending on the considered scale? Location: Páramos (Neo-tropical alpine ecosystems) of Colombia. Methods: We compared vegetation patterns from phytosociological relevés and reconstructed pseudo-communities from herbarium collections in the Colombian high elevation páramo ecosystem using diversity partitioning and Mantel correlations. Results: Species composition differed in the two data sets, which could be explained by taxonomic bias towards charismatic species and overrepresentation of rare species in the herbarium data set, whereas common species were more frequently represented in the phytosociological data set. The two data sets showed a similarly preponderant importance of large-scale differences when we looked at species accumulation across different scales. Small-scale richness contributed more to total richness for the phytosociological data set, while richness at intermediate scales was more important in the herbarium data set. Finally, pairwise β-diversity analyses did not show correlations between data sets, and common species showed similar ecological distribution patterns. Conclusions: We recommend caution to researchers who wish to describe β-diversity patterns in local communities using only herbarium data. However, since the two data sets showed some complementarity in their composition patterns, we suggest that combining data from relevés (or plots) and occurrence data (herbarium records, citizen science, etc.) could be an efficient strategy for describing broader diversity patterns. We discuss the circumstances under which it could be advantageous to work with such combined data sets, in particular in relation to conservation issues.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 07:42:18,,208-219,,1,31,,,,,,,en,,,772269a5-af3e-3333-9797-0eed7a1b32b6,,Script,,10.1111/jvs.12825,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/KZZSA4KY/Bottin et al. - 2020 - Phytosociological data and herbarium collections s.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jvs.12825,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"1100-9233,1654-1103",1100-9233,Journal of Vegetation Science,Wiley,2019-11-27,2019,Phytosociological data and herbarium collections show congruent large‐scale patterns but differ in their local descriptions of community composition,2021-12-19T19:03:09.777982,

They have limited dispersal abilities and rely on the connectivity between habitats and their suitability. In a warming climate, the locations of suitable habitats are expected to change, as is the connectivity. Here, we wondered how climate change might affect shifts in habitat suitability and connectivity of habitat patches, as connectivity is a key element enabling species to realize a potential range shift. We used ecological niche modelling (ENM), combining large-scale climate suitability with local scale, high-resolution habitat features, to identify suitable areas for the two species, under low and high warming scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We associated it with connectivity assessment through graph theory. The variable ‘small ponds’ contributed most to land cover-only ENMs for both species. Projections with climate change scenarios revealed a potential impact of warming on suitable habitat patches for newts, especially for T. cristatus. We observed a decrease in connectivity following a decrease in patch suitability. Our results highlight the important areas for newt habitat connectivity within the study area, and define those potentially threatened by climate warming.

Here, we use four diploid wild wheats that differentially combined into four independent allopolyploid species to test for such additivity and assess the impact of ecological constraints on species ranges. Divergent genetic variation from diploids being fixed in heterozygote allopolyploids supports their genetic additivity. Spatial integration of comparative phylogeography and modelling of climatic niches supports ecological additivity of locally adapted diploid progenitors into allopolyploid species which subsequently colonised wide ranges.

It is aggressively weedy in croplands, field-side ditches, wet areas and along roadsides, especially in slightly acidic, nitrogen-rich, clay-loam soils. In addition to interfering with crop growth, the weed causes dermatitis and eye irritation in humans, skin rashes and sour mouth in domesticated mammals, and off-flavours in cow's milk through forage contamination. Although A. cotula may be managed effectively with some broadleaf herbicides in cereal crops, it is much more difficult to manage in broadleaved crops and cover crops. In some regions, aggressive use of relatively few herbicides has selected for acetolactate synthase herbicide resistance in A. cotula. Therefore, A. cotula poses serious ecological and economic challenges in many regions. Despite this threat, the details of A. cotula biology and ecology in the context of environmental change remain relatively unknown. For example, the reason for the invasiveness of A. cotula remains uncertain, but is presumed to be due to abundant seed production, allelochemicals, mycorrhizal associations, minimal herbivory in invaded ranges, ability to attract generalist pollinators through an extended flowering period and adaptive capacity in a wide range of soil types and conditions.

Andean hummingbirds have undergone a remarkable radiation, with many species exhibiting patchy distributions and, in some cases, taxonomic controversy. An example is the sapphire‐vented puffleg Eriocnemis luciani; ssp. baptistae, luciani and meridae, which some authors merge with the coppery‐naped puffleg E. sapphiropygia; ssp. catharina and sapphiropygia. Each group is distributed either north or south from the Huancabamba Depression, the major biogeographical barrier within the tropical Andes. We investigated whether these subspecies share some niche characteristics despite their geographical separation and determined their meaning in the context of the speciation process of trochilids in the tropical Andes. For each subspecies, we performed geographical predictions and paired tests of niche conservatism in environmental space. Geographical predictions included separate regions for subspecies catharina and sapphiropygia, while the predicted regions for subspecies luciani and baptistae greatly overlapped. The E. l. luciani model predicted a single pixel near to the potential area of E. l. meridae, known only from a unique, old record. Subspecies luciani and baptistae exhibited the greatest niche overlap among the pairs of taxa for most variables. However, our results clearly indicated niche divergence for the four members of the E. luciani–sapphiropygia complex, independent of the similarities or slight dissimilarities in their respective backgrounds, indicating that other forces in addition to variation in environmental parameters, such as natural selection or genetic drift, are driving the radiation of these hummingbirds. This finding coincides with the unusually high speciation rates reported for Andean hummingbirds.

Location North America. Taxon Balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). Methods We compared seven hypotheses, representing effects of past climate and current range position, for their ability to describe the geographic pattern of expected heterozygosity and per cent polymorphic loci across 85 populations of balsam poplar. We tested each hypothesis using spatial and non‐spatial least‐squares regression to assess the importance of spatial autocorrelation on model performance. Results We found that both expected heterozygosity and per cent polymorphic loci could best be explained by the current range position and genetic structure of populations within the contemporary range.

Hypotheses accounting for the effects of past climate (e.g. past climatic suitability, distance from the southern edge), in contrast, had comparatively little support.

Thus, understanding their spread and ecological impacts is critical for management and control. Strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) is an aggressive invader across the tropics and has been rapidly spreading throughout the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. However, both the mechanisms of its spread on the island and the consequences of its invasion on native floral and faunal communities remain largely unexplored. By surveying multiple sites across Madagascar’s eastern rainforests, we demonstrate that the introduction of P. cattleianum significantly correlates with changes in forest structure—namely tree/shrub size, taxonomic richness, and taxonomic diversity. Further, at a local scale, the presence of P. cattleianum was associated with an increase in frugivore species richness; its primary dispersers during our study period were lemurs. Moreover, we identified species-specific effects of lemur gut-passage on the germination of P. cattleianum seeds. Finally, microsatellite analysis of P. cattleianum from a variety of locations across Madagascar demonstrated three distinct, highly differentiated, genetic population clusters, each with high levels of intra-population diversity, suggesting multiple independent introductions of P. cattleianum into Madagascar followed by long-distance dispersal.

These models use a species’ climatic distribution to determine currently suitable areas for the species and project its potential distribution under future climate scenarios. A core, rarely tested, assumption of SDMs is that all populations will respond equivalently to climate. Few studies have examined this assumption, and those that have rarely dissect the reasons for intraspecific differences. Focusing on the arctic‐alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis, we compared predictive accuracy from SDMs constructed using the species’ full global distribution with composite predictions from separate SDMs constructed using subpopulations defined either by genetic or habitat differences. This is one of the first studies to compare multiple ways of constructing intraspecific‐level SDMs with a species‐level SDM. We also examine the contested relationship between relative probability of occurrence and species performance or ecological function, testing if SDM output can predict individual performance (plant size) and biotic interactions (facilitation). We found that both genetic‐ and habitat‐informed SDMs are considerably more accurate than a species‐level SDM, and that the genetic model substantially differs from and outperforms the habitat model. While SDMs have been used to infer population performance and possibly even biotic interactions, in our system these relationships were extremely weak. Our results indicate that individual subpopulations may respond differently to climate, although we discuss and explore several alternative explanations for the superior performance of intraspecific‐level SDMs. We emphasize the need to carefully examine how to best define intraspecific‐level SDMs as well as how potential genetic, environmental, or sampling variation within species ranges can critically affect SDM predictions. We urge caution in inferring population performance or biotic interactions from SDM predictions, as these often‐assumed relationships are not supported in our study.",2020,2020-03-26 02:30:09,2021-01-24 11:50:53,,60-74,,1,43,,,,,,,en,,,62115234-62f3-3a22-855f-a391e0078bf0,,Script,,10.1111/ecog.04630,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/K3ITWWZG/Chardon et al. - 2020 - Incorporating intraspecific variation into species.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/ecog.04630,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0906-7590,1600-0587",0906-7590,Ecography,Wiley,2019-11-05,2019,"Incorporating intraspecific variation into species distribution models improves distribution predictions, but cannot predict species traits for a wide‐spread plant species",2021-07-10T18:49:49.780854,

The goal of the present study was to describe the habitat preference and distribution of the oceanic manta rays, spinetail devil rays, and Chilean devil rays in the coastal area of LSS. We used multiple data sources of mobulid ray sightings and selected significant environmental predictors to execute the maximum entropy model. The model performed well in predicting mobulid ray habitat in the coastal area of LSS and indicated that sea-surface chlorophyll-a (SSC-a), sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), distance to the 200-m isobath, distance to the 3000-m isobath, and slope were all significant environmental predictors of their distribution. This study confirms that the habitat preference of mobulid rays were in the areas that close to the 200-m isobath and with higher chlorophyll-a concentration as proxy for their prey density. Combining habitat models with fisheries activity records indicated that the areas where these overlaps may represent key mobulid habitats. This study highlights a critical need for species-specific and populations-level management measures for Indonesian mobulid rays, whereas current MPA design has focused on a broad-scale coastal ecosystem management approach, which may have limited effectiveness in practice. This study provides valuable information for the improvement of MPA design and fisheries management tools, through maximum entropy modeling as a powerful means to describe species’ distributions and habitat preference. We recommend that future efforts focus on documenting and incorporating data from large-scale commercial fisheries to improve our knowledge of habitat preference and distribution models in offshore areas and the high seas, and to assess the preference for coastal versus oceanic habitats.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-24 11:35:55,,105328,,,198,,,,,,,en,,,d1338102-a85f-3efd-a980-2cb909a7f59e,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105328,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/6QVAI6GD/Putra et al. - 2020 - Predicting mobulid ray distribution in coastal are.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105328,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0964-5691,0964-5691,Ocean & Coastal Management,Elsevier BV,2020-12-01,2020,Predicting mobulid ray distribution in coastal areas of Lesser Sunda Seascape: Implication for spatial and fisheries management,2021-01-18T05:46:19.574881,

However, different taxa may respond to climatic change differently. The Climatic Variability Hypothesis (CVH) suggests that taxa originating from environmentally variable habitats, such as those at high latitudes and altitudes, should evolve wider environmental tolerances and greater dispersal capacity, and consequently be less responsive to climatic change than taxa originating from relatively stable habitats. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis, especially in the Asian tropics, are scarce. In this study, we assessed the range dynamics of 20 tree species, by using the abundance and mean tree diameter and the ratio of juveniles to trees along an altitudinal transect (2450 m–3070 m) in a montane forest located in the southeastern Himalayas in Myanmar. We also compared the suitable range sizes of tree species of different range dynamics category. Among the species investigated, 12 experienced significant upward range extensions and other eight species experienced no-upward extensions. The modeled distribution range size of the ‘upward species’ were marginally significant narrower than those of ‘non-upward’ species. The ‘upward’ species were also often species of tropical evolutionary origin and the ‘non-upward’ species were of subtropics and temperate origin. The mechanism behind these distribution patterns of different species may be complex while the distribution patterns of this 20 species along the altitudinal transect generally support the prediction of the CVH. From the perspective of conserving biodiversity against the impacts of climatic change, more attention needs to be paid to narrowly distributed species, which are typically tropical origin, by enhancing connectivity and dispersal capacity in fragmented landscapes.",2020,2020-03-27 04:25:33,2021-01-24 11:34:20,,e00973,,,22,,,,,,,en,,,f4096505-3004-3685-a9b9-b4a91b354557,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00973,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/DS4U6BCH/Thang et al. - 2020 - Tree species of tropical and temperate lineages in.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e00973,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,2351-9894,2351-9894,Global Ecology and Conservation,Elsevier BV,2020-06-01,2020,Tree species of tropical and temperate lineages in a tropical Asian montane forest show different range dynamics in response to climate change,2021-01-16T07:32:44.826335,

Moreover, their ability to invade biogeographically distinct regions in short timespans poses interesting ecological questions. Lantana camara (sensu lato) is one such invasive species of global concern. In an unprecedented effort, we surveyed 207,100 km2 of Indian forests by sampling 13715 grids of 5 × 5 km, each with 1–31 plots of 10 m diameter, to record the abundance of Lantana. For India, we modeled occupancy of Lantana in the sampled area by accounting for imperfect detection; and potential invasion outside the sampled area using MaxEnt with covariates of climate, soil, forest and human disturbance. Further, Lantana’s response in comparable areas of its native and global invaded range was modeled using MaxEnt to provide a better understanding of its changing relationship with environmental factors. Lantana invaded 154,837 km2 of the surveyed area, and threatened 303,607 km2 of total Indian forests (44%); with preference to warm, humid, fertile areas, degraded by extractive human use. By combining our large-scale ground surveys with published data, we show that Lantana has expanded its climatic niche worldwide, with >11 million km2 suitable for its invasion. Niche comparison revealed that Lantana might have adaptive plasticity in its invaded range; where it was found to be more tolerant to higher temperatures, lower fertility and shade as compared to its native range. In light of Lantana’s introduction history that suggest excessive hybridization between previously allopatric populations, and its known genetic diversity in the invaded range, the existing adaptive plasticity is suggestive of contemporary evolution.

Given that Neotropical and Afrotropical regions have contrasting histories of the megafauna (because of the Holocene megafaunal extinction in the Neotropics), we hypothesize that they should harbour plants with different traits in relationship to herbivory and fire, especially in savannas. We predicted that herbivory resistance traits should be more prominent in Afrotropical savanna plants and fire resistance in Neotropical savanna plants. Location Tropics. Time period Not applicable. Major taxa studied Angiosperms (woody). Methods We compiled data for five key plant functional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum tree height, spinescence and proportion of geoxyles) for forest and savanna woody species from the two distant regions (Afrotropics and Neotropics). We related these data to climate, soil and fire variables and tested predictions for megafauna selection. Results Spines and high wood density were more common among Afrotropical than Neotropical savanna species and species from the two forests. Moreover, the Neotropical savanna region contained more geoxyles than the Afrotropical savanna region. Finally, Afrotropical species were taller than Neotropical species. These differences were consistent with our predictions for trait selection by the megafauna, and these patterns did not change when considering climate, soil and fire regimens in the models.

We found that, selecting the top-ranked 30% (respectively 50%) of areas would conserve 62.4% (86.8%) of the estimated total carbon stock and 67.8% (90.7%) of all clean water provisioning, in addition to improving the conservation status for 69.7% (83.8%) of all species considered.

It can be caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). There is an epidemiological association between mycetoma and the environment, including rainfall, temperature and humidity but there are still many knowledge gaps in the identification of the natural habitat of actinomycetes, their primary reservoir, and their precise geographical distribution. Knowing the potential distribution of this infection and its ecological niche in endemic areas is relevant to determine disease management strategies and etiological agent habitat or reservoirs. Methodology/principal findings This was an ambispective descriptive study of 31 patients with actinomycetoma. We determined the biophysical characteristics including temperature, precipitation, soil type, vegetation, etiological agents, and mapped actinomycetoma cases in Northeast Mexico. We identified two disease cluster areas. One in Nuevo Leon, with a predominantly kastanozems soil type, with a mean annual temperature of 22°, and a mean annual precipitation of 585.2 mm. Herein, mycetoma cases were produced by Actinomadura pelletieri, Actinomadura madurae, Nocardia brasiliensis, and Nocardia spp. The second cluster was in San Luis Potosí, where lithosols soil type predominates, with a mean annual temperature of 23.5° and a mean annual precipitation of 635.4 mm. In this area, all the cases were caused by N. brasiliensis. A. madurae cases were identified in rendzinas, kastanozems, vertisols, and lithosols soils, and A. pelletieri cases in xerosols, kastanozems, and rendzinas soils. Previous thorn trauma with Acacia or Prosopis plants was referred by 35.4% of subjects. In these states, the presence of thorny plants, such as Acacia spp., Prosopis spp., Senegalia greggi, Vachellia farnesiana and Vachellia rigidula, are common.

Important aspects of the timing and geographical setting of angiosperm diversification during this period, and the groups involved, remain uncertain. Here we address these aspects by constructing and dating a new and complete family-level phylogeny, which we integrate with 16 million geographic occurrence records for angiosperms on a global scale.

Its characteristic hand-shaped flower is used in folk medicine and has constituted the iconic symbol of the Sociedad Botánica de México since 1940. Here, the evolutionary history of this species was estimated through phylogeographic analyses of nuclear DNA sequences obtained through restriction site associated DNA sequencing and ecological niche modeling. Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaf samples obtained from a representative number (5 to 10 per sampling site) of individuals distributed along the species geographic range. In Mexico, population is comprised by spatially isolated individuals which may follow the trends of cloud forest fragmentation. By contrast, in Guatemala Chiranthodendron may constitute a canopy dominant species near the Acatenango volcano. The distributional range of this species encompasses geographic provinces separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The objectives of the study were to: (i) estimate its genetic structure to define whether the observed range disjunction exerted by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec translates into separate populations, (ii) link population divergence timing and demographic trends to historical climate change, and (iii) test hypotheses related to Pleistocene refugia. Results Patterns of genetic diversity indicated high levels of genetic differentiation between populations separated by the Isthmus. The western and eastern population diverged approximately 0.873 Million years ago (Ma). Demographic analyses supported a simultaneous split from an ancestral population and rapid expansion from a small stock approximately 0.2 Ma corresponding to a glacial period. The populations have remained stable since the LIG (130 Kilo years ago (Ka)). Species distribution modelling (SDM) predicted a decrease in potential distribution in the Last Interglacial (LIG) and an increase during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (22 Ka), Mid-Holocene (6 Ka) and present times. Conclusions Divergence time estimations support the hypothesis that populations represent Quaternary relict elements of a species with broader and northernmost distribution. Pleistocene climatic shifts exerted major influence on the distribution of populations allowing dispersion during episodes of suitable climatic conditions and structuring during the first interglacial with a time period length of 100 Kilo years (Kyr) and the vicariant influence of the Isthmus. Limited demographic expansion and population connectivity during the LGM supports the moist forest hypothesis model.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 11:20:41,,44,,1,20,,,,,,,en,,,a010a78b-73be-302b-9405-9fc38c6990a5,,Script,,10.1186/s12862-020-01605-8,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/X5NDHGWP/Hernández-Langford et al. - 2020 - Nuclear phylogeography of the temperate tree speci.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Methods We inferred ancestral biomes based on a fossil‐dated molecular phylogeny of 103 species (59% of the clade) and recorded the number of transitions among biomes using biogeographical stochastic mapping based on the dispersal‐extinction‐cladogenesis model.

Recent data‐intensive analysis has shown that, while ecoregions do delineate biotic communities, how distinct they are from one another varies considerably across regions and taxa. Given their central importance to global models of the earth system and to the development of conservation plans, it is key to understand in what regions, and for which taxa, ecoregion classification schemes best describe the underlying variability in biological communities. Location Global. Taxa Plants, animals, fungi. Methods In this paper, we integrate ecoregion maps with data on spatially continuous changes in environmental conditions, biodiversity and species traits to quantify the descriptive power of ecoregions around the globe. Capitalizing on the troves of newly available global biodiversity data, we model the abiotic and biotic factors that describe how distinct ecoregions are from one another. Results From an abiotic perspective, we report compelling evidence that, first, ecoregions are more distinct in tropical zones with higher temperatures, less temperature seasonality and greater rainfall seasonality. Second, we also find that ecoregions are more distinct in regions with steeper slopes. From a biotic perspective, we find that ecoregions tend to be more distinct for reptiles and amphibians than they are for mammals or birds. Likewise, ecoregions tend to be more distinct for smaller‐bodied species and, to a lesser extent, species at lower trophic levels. Main conclusions While ecoregion‐based conservation planning can provide a crucial tool for developing holistic conservation interventions, we show here that the ability to capture and describe communities is not uniform across regions or taxa. In particular, ecoregions tend to best describe communities of small‐bodied species, less vagile and tropical taxa that are typically underrepresented in the scientific literature. While ecoregion classification schemes will continue to provide invaluable conservation guidance, we must think critically about when an ecoregional approach is best suited to informing management.",2020,2020-06-22 05:08:19,2021-01-24 11:20:14,,jbi.13871,,,,,,,,,,en,,,52b08d06-5c13-3d90-8770-116a33a61124,,Script,,10.1111/jbi.13871,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/QQ5J9E8V/Smith et al. - 2020 - The biogeography of ecoregions Descriptive power .pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/jbi.13871,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0305-0270,1365-2699",0305-0270,Journal of Biogeography,Wiley,2020-05-18,2020,The biogeography of ecoregions: Descriptive power across regions and taxa,2021-12-03T16:48:46.428449,

To that end, different methodologies have been employed in order to determine the different variables that compose the environment. In paleoecology, these variables are used for the reconstruction of paleoenvironments. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to reconstruct the environment of the early Miocene of Simojovel, Chiapas, using the taxonomic affinity of flower structures preserved in amber as a proxy. We used the method of the nearest living relative (NLR) for an estimation of the paleovegetation, which resulted in a high evergreen forest with the presence of mangrove elements and flooding zones. The paleoclimatic reconstruction was obtained using the Mutual Ecogeographic Range (MER) method, which resulted in a mean annual temperature of 24.19 ± 1.79 °C and a mean precipitation of 1745 ± 336 mm per year. These results indicate that the environmental conditions of the Miocene of Chiapas exhibited a tropical climate warmer (+1.99 °C) and drier (−337.7 mm) than the Present.

Cervidae (deer) population densities and community structure have undergone drastic changes in many parts of the world over the past decades, often with deer populations increasing. Many studies show impacts of Cervidae on multiple ecosystem properties, including vegetation and biodiversity, at local spatial scales. At larger spatial scales, however, impacts of changing Cervidae populations on forest ecosystems are less known. Although both abiotic and biotic dimensions contribute to shaping species’ niches, abiotic variables are generally given prominence when modelling species habitats and ranges. This is despite biotic changes, including changes in trophic structure, being an important component of global environmental change. In this study, we examined the potential contribution of Cervidae densities to the habitat suitability for rare plant and lichen species across the temperate and boreal forests of Norway, where cervid densities have increased over the past 60 years. We also examined how these changes in herbivore communities may have shaped habitat suitability for rare lichens and plants and discuss the results in light of continuing shifts in herbivore assemblages. We ran habitat suitability models for 47 species of rare plants and lichens, which were selected based on herbivory reported as a criterion for placement on the national red list for species. Climate (temperature and precipitation), forest (forest type and productivity), soil pH and Cervidae densities (moose Alces alces, red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) were used as independent variables. Densities of one or more of the three Cervidae species were inferred to be associated with the distribution of 14 (ten lichen, one bryophyte and three vascular plant species) of these 47 species. We found a range of habitat suitability associations with Cervidae densities, including positive, negative and hump-backed responses. Increases in Cervidae densities over the past 60 years may have led to different spatial trends in habitat suitability across the 14 species. Our results suggest that Cervidae densities are associated with the distribution of rare forest plant and lichen species differently at large spatial scales; experimental studies should test the causality of these associations. If causal, this implies that Cervidae management should find a balance between high and low densities to conserve several plant and lichen species. The preponderance of epiphytic lichens species, for which habitat suitability was associated with Cervidae densities, calls for field studies to focus on Cervidae impacts on forest lichens.",2020,2020-08-03 04:48:00,2021-01-24 11:16:53,,118286,,,473,,,,,,,en,,,abf70bf0-5976-3fd1-8da8-1cd653779236,,Script,,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118286,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/VUCQPC2T/Speed et al. - 2020 - Increasing Cervidae populations have variable impa.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118286,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,hybrid,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0378-1127,0378-1127,Forest Ecology and Management,Elsevier BV,2020-10-01,2020,Increasing Cervidae populations have variable impacts on habitat suitability for threatened forest plant and lichen species,2021-01-14T23:15:21.831774,

For this, we estimated the geographic distribution of 719 bird species under current and future climate (2050 and 2070) projections considering two dispersal ability assumptions (contiguous dispersal vs. no dispersal). Then, using Sørensen-based multiple-site dissimilarity and range-diversity plots analyses, we assessed the potential changes of range size and covariance in species composition, as well as in alpha and beta diversities across NSDF and within the current Protected Areas (PAs). Over 77% of species tended to reduce their potential distributional ranges for years 2050 and 2070 (regardless climate and dispersal scenarios), including several species extirpations from the NSDF. In fact, considering the contiguous dispersion, we observed that, on average, only ∼7% of species will be favored (increasing >10% their current distributional areas) by new climate conditions. We estimated a general decrease in local species richness and increase in Whittaker’s beta diversity across NSDF and PAs under future scenarios, which is indicative of biotic heterogeneity. This scenario suggests that NSDF’s avian assemblages could be prone to an uneven structural reorganization (likely decreasing the taxonomic similarity between sites) as a consequence of climate change.

Here, we ask how both the distribution and phenology of three food-producing shrubs native to northwestern North America might shift as the climate changes. To address this question, we compared gridded climate data with species location data to identify climate variables that best predicted the current bioclimatic niches of beaked hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium), and salal (Gaultheria shallon). We also developed thermal-sum models for the timing of flowering and fruit ripening for these species. We then used multi-model ensemble future climate projections to estimate how species range and phenology may change under future conditions. Modelling efforts showed extreme minimum temperature, climate moisture deficit, and mean summer precipitation were predictive of climatic suitability across all three species. Future bioclimatic niche models project substantial reductions in habitat suitability across the lower elevation and southern portions of the species’ current ranges by the end of the 21st century. Thermal-sum phenology models for these species indicate that flowering and the ripening of fruits and nuts will advance an average of 25 days by the mid-21st century, and 36 days by the late-21st century under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5).

In this report, we update and incorporate additional data to provide new maps of wild boar suitability with a resolution of 2x2 km, obtained from a presence-only algorithm, and a new model based on hunting yield data for MS and neighbouring countries.

Internal validations and comparisons among previous and new suitability and hunting yield models were also addressed, as well as external evaluation of the best new approach at European scale (at country level). The suitability map showed a good agreement with the expert-derived species range published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. New models of relative abundance performed in general better than the previous one according to internal validations, concretely the two-step independent bioregion approach gives the best validation scores. This approach solved the abrupt changes in predictions between bioregion boundaries. As with the previous model, the external evaluation of the new model based on hunting yield presented certain over-prediction of the total hunting bags reported per country, although a high linearity between observed and predicted values was achieved. Previous and new hunting yield model predictions showed disagreements particularly in North and East regions, and other scattered areas in South and West, being areas in which the new model provides more reliable predictions.

One such question has intrigued population geneticists, biogeographers, and conservation biologists: What determines intraspecific genetic diversity? This question is challenging to answer because many factors may influence genetic variation, including life history traits, historical influences, and geography, and the relative importance of these factors varies across taxonomic and geographic scales. Furthermore, interpreting the influence of numerous, potentially correlated variables is difficult with traditional statistical approaches. To address these challenges, we combined repurposed data with machine learning and investigated predictors of genetic diversity, focusing on Nearctic amphibians as a case study. We aggregated species traits, range characteristics, and >42,000 genetic sequences for 299 species using open-access scripts and various databases. After identifying important predictors of nucleotide diversity with random forest regression, we conducted follow-up analyses to examine the roles of phylogenetic history, geography, and demographic processes on intraspecific diversity. Although life history traits were not important predictors for this dataset, we found significant phylogenetic signal in genetic diversity within amphibians. We also found that salamander species at northern latitudes contain lower genetic diversity.

In principle, to reflect the ecological niche of a species well, ENMs should incorporate environmental predictors that consider its full vertical habitat, yet examples of such models are rare. Here we present the first application of ‘3D’ ENMs to 10 Southern Ocean lanternfish species. This 3D approach incorporates depth-specific environmental predictor data to identify the distribution of suitable habitat across multiple depth levels. Results were compared to those from the more common ‘2D’ approach, which uses only environmental data from the sea surface. Measures of model discriminatory ability and overfitting indicated that 2D models often outperform 3D methods, even when accounting for reduced available sample size in the 3D models. Nevertheless, models for species with a known affinity for deeper habitat benefitted from the 3D approach, and our results suggest that species can track their ecological niche in latitude and depth leading to equatorward or poleward range extensions beyond that expected from incorporating only surface data. However, since 3D models require comprehensive depth-specific data, both data availability and the need for depth-specific model outputs must be considered when choosing the appropriate modelling approach. We advocate increased effort to include depth-resolved environmental parameters within marine ENMs. This will require collection of mesopelagic species occurrence data using appropriate temporal and depth-stratified methods, and inclusion of accurate depth information when occurrence records are submitted to global biodiversity databases.",2020,2020-10-12 06:32:56,2021-01-24 11:13:29,,179-193,,,647,,,,,,,en,,,ed55802f-e1cd-3a55-b077-913c49293247,,Script,,[Data DOI provided on GBIF request] 10.3354/meps13384,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/IEITRCN5/Freer et al. - 2020 - Estimating circumpolar distributions of lanternfis.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.3354/meps13384,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"0171-8630,1616-1599",0171-8630,Marine Ecology Progress Series,Inter-Research Science Center,2020-08-13,2020,Estimating circumpolar distributions of lanternfish using 2D and 3D ecological niche models,2021-12-06T05:46:02.424760,

Well managed and appropriately located marine parks and marine protected areas (MPAs) have potential to enhance shark conservation by restricting fisheries and protecting suitable habitat for threatened shark populations. Here, we used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries to determine suitable habitat for pelagic sharks within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and to quantify the amount of suitable habitat contained within existing MPAs. We developed generalised linear models using proportional occurrences of pelagic sharks for three families: Alopiidae (thresher), Carcharhinidae (requiem), and Lamnidae (mackerel) sharks. We also considered aggregated species from the Lamnidae and Carcharhinidae families (‘combined sharks’ in the models). Using a set of environmental predictors known to affect shark occurrence, including chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, sea surface temperature, and turbidity, as well as geomorphological, geophysical, and sedimentary parameters, we found that models including sea surface temperature and turbidity were ranked highest in their ability to predict shark distributions. We used these results to predict geographic regions where habitat was most suitable for pelagic sharks within the Australian EEZ, and our results revealed that suitable habitat was limited in no-take zones within MPAs. For all shark groupings, suitable habitats were found mostly at locations exposed to fishing pressure, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the pelagic shark species considered.

The task is even more important when human pressure on tropical—megadiverse—ecosystems is considered. However, due to financial constraints, spatial and temporal prioritization is required. Here, we used the concept of environmental complementarity to identify non‐surveyed regions for bats that are environmentally different from other already surveyed regions. We highlighted regions in Brazil where field inventories could be conducted to locate new occurrences or even new bat species. Location Brazil. Methods We based our analysis on environmental characterization aiming to identify dissimilar regions to those already sampled for bats in Brazil. We used 21 environmental variables to characterize 1,531 unique localities where bats occur. Then, we applied the parameters of a generalized linear model (GLM) to extrapolate the expected values of the environmental variables for the entire country. We compared the predicted values of localities with newly described bat species occurrence against the values for other bat species. Results We found that sites from which recently discovered species were described are environmentally distinct from the sites where previously described species occur. Therefore, new occurrences and even new species could be found in regions that are environmentally dissimilar from those already surveyed. By crossing the model with a human footprint map, we defined temporal priorities for field inventories. Regions such as the Northern Cerrado and Western Caatinga should be surveyed first. Similar approaches could be undertaken for other biological groups or regions, allowing the identification of spatial congruence and the development of a comprehensive national programme for biological field inventories.

We aimed to determine if San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina Archipelago could be considered as a hotspot of elasmobranch diversity within the Greater Caribbean. For that, we updated the elasmobranch species richness and analyze its distribution pattern, evaluated the assembly structure and composition and estimated the occurrence probability of the more abundant species of the Archipelago. A total of 46 species, 33 of sharks and 13 of batoids were recorded, with 8 categorized as threatened by IUCN. Quadrants of San Andres and Providencia islands presented the highest richness with 16 species. Oceanic environments differed significantly in composition and abundance from the other four large areas evaluated. Northern banks were the most favorable environments for large-sized pelagic sharks while San Andres and Providencia Islands were for batoids; this difference could be due to the pelagic and benthic habits, respectively, and their relation with availability of substrate, food and sheltered areas. Our study confirmed that the Archipelago has at least 21% of the total richness of the northwestern Atlantic region, 43% of that of the Greater Caribbean and 49% of that registered in the Colombian Caribbean Coast, suggesting that the Archipelago is a potential richness hotspot in the Caribbean region. This high elasmobranch diversity could be due, among others, to its status as a Biosphere Reserve, to its high diversity of habitats and more recently to the establishment of the shark fishing ban.",2020,2020-11-03 01:00:13,2021-01-24 11:12:33,,1371-1389,,11,103,,,,,,,en,,,f9caa387-9fc8-3d2d-a76d-8c18eed3cdda,,Script,,10.1007/s10641-020-01029-9,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/NXH99XAK/Mejía-Falla et al. - 2020 - Richness and distribution patterns of elasmobranch.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

The most characteristic and least correlated variables were selected for modeling after a collinearity test. Under current climatic conditions, ~51% of the national area was found to be favorable for cultivation and conservation of the species. Under future climate projections, our models predict that favorable habitats of this species will decline by 12% (RCP4.5) and 13% (RCP8.5) by 2070.

When we combined all data, we found startling under-sampling in regions with the most dramatic trajectories of climate change and across biomes. We also found support for the hypothesis that community science observations are filling more gaps in sampling but are more biased towards areas with the highest human footprint. Finally, we found that both types of occurrences have familial-level taxonomic completeness biases, in contrast to the hypothesis of less taxonomic bias in natural history collections data.

We followed these recommendations by developing and comparing ordination and species distribution models (SDMs) of two important woody IAPS in Eastern Africa, Prosopis juliflora and Lantana camara, and interpreting the results to inform IAPS management. The two species differ in their invasion history in Eastern Africa; while L. camara was widely introduced there in the 19th century, P. juliflora was only planted at selected locations in the 1970s and 1980s. For the SDMs, machine learning algorithms were used to generate one ensemble model each for P. juliflora and L. camara. For ordination, we used bioclimatic variables, performed a principal component analysis, and compared the native and global niches of the species with the Eastern African niche. Niches varied substantially depending on the percentage of marginal climates excluded from the models. Additional analysis of the local niches surrounding the original P. juliflora plantations showed that they are complementary, which may have led to an overestimation of regional niche filling. While niche expansion was absent or small depending on the percentage of marginal climates excluded, analysis of the stages of invasion suggested that P. juliflora may have started to adapt to novel climatic conditions and that L. camara is approaching a pseudo‐stable equilibrium in Eastern Africa. The SDMs showed that large areas in Eastern Africa that have not yet been invaded by P. juliflora are suitable or will become suitable with climate change. For L. camara, the global SDM predicted a considerably larger suitable area than the Eastern African one, raising uncertainty about the areas to be included in a regional management strategy. Thus, combining ordination and SDMs and integrating a geographic component into ordination is useful in assessing IAPS invasion stages and potential niche shifts, and the results help inform IAPS policy and management.

Yet, specific mechanisms that define thermal sensitivity of cardiac function remain unclear. Here we investigated whole animal metabolism, cardiac performance and mitochondrial function in response to elevated temperatures for temperate, subtropical and tropical spiny lobster species. While oxygen demands increased with rising temperatures, heart function became limited or declined in all three species of lobsters. The decline in cardiac performance coincided with decreases in mitochondrial efficiency through increasing mitochondrial proton leakage, which predicts impaired compensation of ATP production. Species differences were marked by shifts in mitochondrial function, with the least thermal scope apparent for tropical lobsters. We conclude that acute temperature stress of spiny lobsters, irrespective of their climatic origin, is marked by declining cellular energetic function of the heart, contributing to an increasing loss of whole animal performance.

Many native grasses have limited success in seed-based restoration (e.g. post-mine rehabilitation) and commercial industries (e.g. agriculture) due to poor seed germination and handling. Seed-enhancement technologies can assist in overcoming these barriers. This study aimed to use combinations of seed enhancements to overcome the germination and handling challenges in two dominant Australian native grass species with demand in restoration and commercial industries (Triodia wiseana C.A Gardner and Rytidosperma caespitosum [Gaudich.] Connor & Edgar). Selected enhancements included hydropriming (including inoculation with karrikinolide [KAR1]), flash flaming, and seed coating. Combinations of these seed enhancements allowed improvements in both germination (by up to 55% and 18% for T. wiseana and R. caespitosum, respectively) and floret geometry (flowability, as measured through a mechanised seeder, improved by up to 6-fold and 17-fold for T. wiseana and R. caespitosum, respectively), with the order of enhancement application being important. The responses of each species to enhancements corresponded with key biological processes and ecological cues required for recruitment events in nature, such as fire and rainfall events. Tridoia wiseana germination was driven by fire-related cues (i.e. KAR1, flaming), while R. caespitosum germination was highest in response to moisture-related cues (i.e. hydro-priming). Responses to seed enhancements (and combinations of) may have implications for the management and scaled use of the targeted species. This can assist in improving the restoration and commercial success of the study species, and potentially other grasses with germination and handling challenges, into the future.

Waterlilies (Nymphaea) are widespread in northern Australia, and their loss from these wetlands will be detrimental, both ecologically and culturally. This study aimed to define the regeneration tolerance of Nymphaea to increased salinity through quantifying the effects of salinity on seed germination and early seedling growth in four Nymphaea species. Seed germination and seedling growth were assessed under a gradient of salinity concentrations. Seeds that did not germinate after salinity exposure were assessed for their ability to recover in fresh water. For all species, there was a significant reduction in germination when seeds were exposed to salinities of ≥ 100 mM NaCl. Total seedling biomass was less sensitive to increasing salinity than germination, however declined significantly across all species at salinities ≥ 100 mM NaCl. Ungerminated seeds from all salinity treatments displayed some degree of recovery when transferred to fresh water. For the majority of species, however, seed germination of these transferred seeds never reached the percentages observed in the non-saline controls. For most species of Nymphaea, any salinization event reaching ≥ 100 mM NaCl will significantly reduce recruitment from seeds, irrespective of whether saline water is flushed from the system.

In the field, Australian populations rarely produced viable seeds. A cross-pollination experiment found that Australian plants are fertile, yet lack compatible mates within Australia. Genetic analysis revealed that Australian individuals descend from a small set of self-incompatible genetic clones, which explains the negligible seed set within Australia. Our results show that low genetic diversity, leading to mate incompatibility, inhibits invasiveness of Australian S. altissima, and provides compelling evidence for genetic, rather than ecological, factors constraining invasion in Australia.",2020,2020-03-01 23:31:27,2021-02-10 06:50:56,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/nph.16496,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/QLQ4D2KU/Uesugi et al. - 2020 - A lack of genetically compatible mates constrains .pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1111/nph.16496,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0028-646X,1469-8137",0028-646X,New Phytologist,Wiley,2020-03-23,2020,A lack of genetically compatible mates constrains the spread of an invasive weed,2021-11-07T17:56:08.788510,

The transition from oviparity (egg-laying) to viviparity (live-bearing) has occurred independently in many animal lineages, but there are few phenotypic intermediates. The lizard Saiphos equalis exhibits bimodal reproduction, with some viviparous populations, and other oviparous populations with long-egg-retention, a rare trait where most of embryonic development occurs inside the mother prior to late ovipositioning. We posit that oviparous S. equalis represent an intermediate form between “true” oviparity and viviparity. We used transcriptomics to compare uterine gene expression in these two phenotypes, and provide a molecular model for the genetic control and evolution of reproductive mode. Many genes are differentially expressed throughout the reproductive cycle of both phenotypes, which have clearly different gene expression profiles overall. The differentially expressed genes within oviparous and viviparous individuals have broadly similar biological functions putatively important for sustaining embryos, including uterine remodelling, respiratory gas and water exchange, and immune regulation. These functional similarities indicate either that long egg-retention is an exaptation for viviparity, or might reflect parallel evolution of similar gravidity-related changes in gene expression in long egg-retention oviparity. In contrast, gene expression changes across the reproductive cycle of long-egg-retaining oviparous S. equalis are dramatically different from those of “true” oviparous skinks (such as Lampropholis guichenoti), supporting our assertion that oviparous S. equalis exhibit an intermediate phenotype between “true” oviparity and viviparity.",2020,2020-03-20 00:37:25,2021-02-10 06:50:25,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1111/mec.15409,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/E3G3ZK5D/Foster et al. - 2020 - Emergence of an evolutionary innovation Gene expr.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1111/mec.15409,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,bronze,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0962-1083,1365-294X",0962-1083,Molecular Ecology,Wiley,2020-04-01,2020,Emergence of an evolutionary innovation: Gene expression differences associated with the transition between oviparity and viviparity,2021-12-03T16:48:58.984655,

Location The dry, western side of the Great Dividing Range in northern New South Wales, eastern Australia. Taxon The rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa, Moraceae), its pollinator and the pollinator's parasitoids. Methods We measured fruit (syconia) set per tree, seed set per syconium and fig-wasp numbers (pollinators and non-pollinators) per syconium in a total of 62 trees in 24 populations covering three distributional zones – the dry, western margin of the species’ range, a more mesic, eastern margin at the species’ altitudinal limit, and the zone between these two margins. These results were modelled against F. rubiginosa population size, the position of plant populations in relation to range margins, and climatic gradients of temperature and rainfall. Results Lower rates of pollinator parasitism and less pollinator competition correlated with increased reproductive success in the pollinator and increased male fitness (in terms of pollen dispersal) and female fitness (in terms of seed per syconium) in isolated trees of F. rubiginosa, compared with trees in larger populations, particularly at F. rubiginosa's mesic, expanding range margin. Main Conclusions Pollinator–predator release and pollinator–competition release can lead to increased pollinator and plant reproductive success in pioneer trees at range margins.

Given the risks associated with reliance upon a single species, it would be prudent to identify other taxa that could be managed to provide crop pollination services. We reviewed the literature relating to the distribution, efficiency and management potential of a number of flies (Diptera) known to visit pollinator-dependent crops in Australia and worldwide. Applying this information, we identified the taxa most suitable to play a greater role as managed pollinators in Australian crops. Of the taxa reviewed, flower visitation by representatives from the dipteran families Calliphoridae, Rhiniidae and Syrphidae was frequently reported in the literature. While data available are limited, there was clear evidence of pollination by these flies in a range of crops. A review of fly morphology, foraging behaviour and physiology revealed considerable potential for their development as managed pollinators, either alone or to augment honey bee services. Considering existing pollination evidence, along with the distribution, morphology, behaviour and life history traits of introduced and endemic species, 11 calliphorid, two rhiniid and seven syrphid species were identified as candidates with high potential for use in Australian managed pollination services.

To summarise progress to date and to highlight important considerations for future users, we review 283 studies that apply SDMs to fungi. We found that macrofungi, lichens, and pathogenic microfungi are most often studied. While many studies only aim to model species response to environmental covariates, the use of SDMs for explicitly predicting fungal occurrence in space and time is growing. Many studies collect fungal occurrence data, but the use of pre-collected records from reference collections and citizen science programs is increasing. Challenges of applying SDMs to fungi include detection and sampling biases, and uncertainties in identification and taxonomy. Further, finding environmental covariates at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is important, as fungi can respond to fine-scale environmental patterns. Fine-scale covariate data can be difficult to gather across space, but we show remote-sensing measurements are viable for fungi SDMs. For those fungi interacting with host species, host information is also important, and can be used as covariates in SDMs. We also highlight that competition among fungi, and dispersal, can affect observed distributions, with the latter particularly prominent for invasive fungi. We show how one can account for these processes in models, when suitable data are available. Finally, we note that environmental DNA records create new opportunities and challenges for future modelling efforts, and discuss the difficulties in predicting invasions and climate change impacts. The application of SDMs to fungi has already provided interesting lessons on how to adapt modelling tools for specific questions, and fungi will continue to be relevant test subjects for further technical development of SDMs.",2020,2020-02-19 05:50:42,2021-02-10 06:45:21,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1016/j.fbr.2020.01.002,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/5WBZ4FSM/Hao et al. - 2020 - Using Species Distribution Models For Fungi.pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1016/j.fbr.2020.01.002,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1749-4613,1749-4613,Fungal Biology Reviews,Elsevier BV,2020-06-01,2020,Using Species Distribution Models For Fungi,2021-01-14T01:58:33.813274,

We experimentally investigated the interaction of the generalist moth Helicoverpa punctigera Wallengren (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) with four of its native host plants, two designated primary hosts and two secondary hosts (based on field observations). We tested whether primary host plants support higher survival rates of larvae and whether they are more attractive to ovipositing moths and feeding larvae. We also evaluated whether relative attractiveness of host plants for oviposition matches larval survival rates on them—the preference-performance hypothesis. Moths laid significantly more eggs on two of the four host plant species, one of them a primary host, the other a secondary host. Larvae developed best when reared on the attractive secondary host, developed at intermediate levels on the two primary hosts, and performed worst on the less attractive secondary host. Relative attractiveness of the four host plants to caterpillars differed from that of the moths. Neither adult nor larval attraction to host plants fully supported the preference-performance hypothesis, but oviposition was better correlated with larval survival rates than was larval attraction.

Araceae provide a plant model for investigating plant–pollinator interactions, but few studies have investigated intraspecific variation in their pollination systems. Typhonium brownii (Araceae) is distributed widely across 2000 km from tropical to temperate latitudes in Australia, yet the existence of intraspecific variation and ecotypes has not been investigated. Typhonium brownii from five regions, potentially representing distinct taxa, and populations of the sister species, T. eliosurum, were studied to explore pollinator and floral trait divergence. We characterize significant intraspecific floral trait variation in T. brownii, indicating the existence of a species complex, despite the taxa trapping similar Coleoptera (Staphylinidae, Scarabaeidae). Although all T. brownii showed similar temperature increases in the appendix, there were significant shifts in the timing and pattern of thermogenic and anthesis rhythms between regions (taxa), and all T. brownii taxa had distinct scent compositions, with T. sp. aff. brownii being the most dissimilar to other taxa. In contrast, T. eliosurum inflorescences almost exclusively trapped Diptera (Sphaeroceridae, Psychodidae), had modest temperature increases confined to the staminate zone and had a distinct scent profile which differed from all T. brownii taxa; this scent was confirmed in field bioassays to be important for pollinator attraction. Prevalent volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by T. eliosurum and T. brownii taxa included the common dung constituents skatole, indole and p-cresol. Typhonium eliosurum and T. brownii taxa further differed significantly in morphology and trapping mechanisms, particularly the fly-pollinated T. eliosurum.

Arthraxon hispidus (hairy jointgrass) is a listed threatened species in New South Wales (NSW), but there is limited information on its habitat preferences and native vegetation associations, as well as the impact of historical and ongoing anthropogenic disturbance on its distribution and abundance. In the present study, populations of A. hispidus on the north coast of NSW were surveyed to investigate the habitat characteristics associated with various occurrences of the species. Its preferred habitat was found to be dense ground-cover formations in high-moisture, low-canopy conditions. Cover was highest in moisture-associated assemblages in and around wetlands, drainage lines and groundwater seepages, often in association with native grasses, sedges and herbs. These findings suggest that naturally open freshwater wetland communities comprise the most plausible native habitat niches for A. hispidus populations on the north coast of NSW. A. hispidus also occurs widely among introduced pastures and weeds in previously forested areas, demonstrating the species’ potential to exploit derived habitat. Results indicate that, although ongoing disturbance continues to promote A. hispidus in these exotic-dominated landscapes where historical clearing has created potential habitat opportunities, anthropogenic disturbance (slashing or cattle grazing) is not necessary to sustain A. hispidus within native-dominated wetland communities.

We investigated the diet of the endangered meso-predator, the eastern quoll Dasyurus viverrinus. We also opportunistically observed foraging behaviour, enabling us to examine risks associated with foraging. Sixty captive-bred eastern quolls were reintroduced to an unfenced reserve on mainland Australia (where introduced predators are managed) over a two year period (2018, 2019). Quolls were supplementary fed macropod meat but were also able to forage freely. Dietary analysis of scats (n = 56) revealed that quolls ate macropods, small mammals, birds, invertebrates, fish, reptiles and frogs, with some between-year differences in the frequency of different diet categories. We also observed quolls hunting live prey. Quolls utilised supplementary feeding stations, indicating that this may be an important strategy during the establishment phase. Our study demonstrated that, in a novel environment, captive-bred quolls were able to locate food and hunt live prey. However, foraging was not without risks; with the ingestion of toxic substances and foraging in dangerous environments found to be potentially harmful.

In mammals, they have been most well-studied in rodents, but only in a handful of species. The genus Rattus is one of the most species-rich genera of mammals, with a natural distribution from Asia to Australia and a nearly global distribution for a few species that spread through human commensalism. More than one-third of Rattus species are the result of a recent and rapid radiation on continental Australia (Sahul) centred on the island of New Guinea. The two most widespread species resulting from this radiation, Rattus fuscipes and Rattus leucopus, occur sympatrically in the Wet Tropics region of Queensland, Australia. Despite their recent divergence, morphological similarity, and ability to produce fertile offspring in captivity, hybrids of the two species have not been reported in the wild, suggesting that premating isolation mechanisms maintain the species’ boundaries. Odorant cues are a plausible mechanism that these species could use to identify mates of the same species, but the chemical composition of their odours has not been characterized. With allozyme data from 166 specimens of the two species we confirmed the absence of gene flow between the species in sympatry. From chemical analysis of preputial glands of 32 males from sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species we identified 120 volatile organic compounds of which 80 were reliably quantitated for statistical analysis. Some of these chemicals have been indicated as signalling compounds in other species of mammals, including seven thiazolines. Among them two (2-sec-butylthiazoline and 2-isopropythiazoline) have been previously detected in a rodent, the House Mouse, Mus musculus, and are involved in social interactions including attracting females. We demonstrate that R. fuscipes and R. leucopus are quantitatively and qualitatively distinguishable by the chemical composition of their preputial gland secretions. In comparison to allopatric subspecies, sympatric species contained more unique chemical compounds and a higher abundance of compounds overall, suggesting that sympatric populations have more complex and concentrated odours. Together these results indicate that odorant chemistry has evolved rapidly in these two species, with substantial differences among species and subspecies, especially in sympatry. Ultimately, the rapid evolution of chemical signals involved in mate recognition may help to explain the exceptional diversity of species in the genus Rattus.",2020,2020-12-18 00:22:20,2021-02-11 10:37:28,,,,5,72,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.3853/j.2201-4349.72.2020.1721,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/JSLT2SW6/Rowe et al. - 2020 - Odorants differentiate Australian Rattus with incr.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Map,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

We deployed 50 motion-sensor cameras (spaced closely together in a grid 500 × 1000 m) on Melville Island (Northern Territory, Australia), between June 2018 and May 2019. Cameras were baited and secured to trees ~3 m above the ground on a bracket facing the trunk.

We detected P. pirata 16 times on eight cameras over the duration of the study, finding that detection was most likely on large (DBH >41.5 cm) E. tetrodonta trees during the wet season. Our results indicate that survey effort for this species should be seasonally targeted and focussed on large trees. However, the efficacy of additional methods (nest boxes, Elliott traps) and a comparison between detections on arboreal versus ground-based cameras requires further investigation.

Citizen science is increasingly used for collecting species observational data at wide spatial and temporal scales that are difficult and expensive to achieve using traditional means. Current apps used for citizen science biodiversity monitoring provide methods to record observational data on species’ presence, including photos, location, date, time and an assortment of other data. However, data about species absences as well as automatically generated and accurate data on both search effort and search locations have been lacking. Koala Counter is a free, cross-platform (Android & iOS), open-source app that was developed for a citizen science project to collect koala population data to inform koala conservation and management in South Australia. The app uses mobile phone sensors to transparently and automatically record metadata such as species observation location and time, the search path the user takes, the time taken while searching and GPS location precision. We tested this in the Citizen Science event “The Great Koala Count 2” in South Australia during November 2016. Observations, paths and search effort data were accurate overall. Location accuracy was good, with some exceptions. Use of the app indicated a number of potential improvements that would further increase data quality. Recording search paths offers a potentially valuable method of recording spatial and temporal components of search effort, improving on simple records of species observations and time taken, especially when no observations are made. These data may enable better ecological modelling by supplying accurate search effort data as well as enabling improved inference of species absence.

However, assessing dietary composition can be challenging because most animals are seldom observed eating, especially when studying rare or cryptic species. Aims Morphological analysis of scats has been extensively used previously, and recent advances in the accessibility of DNA barcoding techniques have also made molecular approaches a viable alternative for diet analysis from scats. We compared the results from two methods of scat analysis, to trial the use of contemporary approaches in scat analysis. Methods In the present study, we used morphological analysis and DNA barcoding of matter in scats to catalogue the diet of a generalist omnivore, the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis Thylacomyidae), in the West Kimberley. The composition and diversity of diet items, as well as the taxonomic identification level, were compared between methods. Key results Each method provided complimentary results; morphological analysis uncovered the type of matter consumed (e.g. root, seed) and relative proportion of the total undigested content, whereas DNA barcoding could assign such matter to a taxon. Even though dietary DNA could be extracted from only 38% of scats, DNA barcoding identified a greater diversity of taxa in scats than did morphological analyses. Barcoding could detect the presence of highly-digestible items such as cossid moths (Cossidae) and spiders (Araneae). Conclusions Morphological analysis was useful for quantifying relative abundance of diet categories; however, DNA barcoding detected a greater diversity of dietary items within scats. Despite the expense of DNA barcoding, the method can more accurately identify the taxa consumed, whereas morphology can greatly underestimate dietary species diversity. However, the technical requirements for performing DNA analysis make it expensive, while resource-limited field ecologists can generally perform morphological analysis with appropriate training. Implications Researchers and land managers will benefit from using both approaches in concert to gain a robust understanding of the local bilby diet. However, the cost and limitations of DNA barcoding (particularly when dealing with degraded DNA) mean that this approach should only be employed when the quality of the genetic material within samples is suitable. We recommend conducting exploratory analysis using morphological analysis (potentially in the field), with follow-up DNA barcoding to detect highly digestible items in fresh scats.",2020,2020-12-17 23:28:12,2021-02-15 04:33:48,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1071/WR19079,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/KQXFLDAG/Dawson et al. - 2020 - Comparison of morphological and molecular methods .pdf,,2 - ALA cited,10.1071/WR19079,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

The external structures surrounding the grass seed (i.e., the floret) possess hairs, awns, and appendages which create blockages in conventional seeding equipment. Flash flaming is a patented technology which allows precision exposure of floret material to flames to singe off hairs and appendages. We used two grasses native to Mediterranean ecosystems of Western Australia (Amphipogon turbinatus R.Br. and Neurachne alopecuoidea R.Br.) to evaluate the effects of different flaming techniques on flow properties and germination. Flaming significantly improved flowability in both species and had both neutral (A. turbinatus) and negative (N. alopecuroidea) effects on germination. Flaming torch size influenced germination, though flaming temperature (low or high) and whether this was kept constant or alternating had no effect. The best evaluation of germination following flaming was achieved by cleaning flamed florets to seed and/or germinating in the presence of karrikinolide (KAR1) or gibberellic acid (GA3).

A close relationship was found between the outlying northernmost population (near West Wyalong) and those in the Victorian Goldfields despite a large disjunction between them. Conclusions Patterns of genetic variation are consistent with a history of vicariant differentiation of disjunct populations. We infer that an early disjunction to develop in the species distribution was that across the Lower Murray Basin, an important biogeographical barrier separating many dry sclerophyll plant taxa in southeastern Australia. Additionally, our results suggest that the western populations fragmented earlier than the eastern ones. Fragmentation, both west and east of the Murray Basin, is likely tied to climatic changes associated with glacial-interglacial cycles although it remains possible that major geological events including uplift of the Mount Lofty Ranges and basalt flows in the Newer Volcanics Province also played a role.",2020,2021-01-04 23:51:34,2021-02-11 11:21:33,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1002/ece3.7099,,"/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/Q2PFXDRR/Fahey et al. - 2020 - Divergent lineages in a semi-arid mallee species, .pdf",,1 - ALA used; Contact for data DOI; Species occurrence records; Map; Climate Data,10.1002/ece3.7099,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"2045-7758,2045-7758",2045-7758,Ecology and Evolution,Wiley,2020-12-15,2020,"Divergent lineages in a semi‐arid mallee species, Eucalyptus behriana , correspond to a major geographic break in southeastern Australia",2021-12-04T10:10:55.331974,

Because they lack a planktonic larval stage, it has been hypothesized that marine benthic amphipod crustaceans may have short dispersal distances, high endemicity, and spatial turnover in species composition, and consequently high global species richness. In this study, we examined over 400000 distribution records of 4876 amphipod species, and identified 12 regions of endemicity. The number and percent of endemic species peaked at 30°-35°S and coincided with 3 of these regions of high endemicity: Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Pelagic species of marine amphipod crustaceans were more cosmopolitan than benthic species. The latitudinal patterns of richness (alpha, gamma, and ES50) and species turnover were at least bimodal. Most occurrence records and greater alpha and gamma richness were in mid-latitudes, reflecting sampling bias. Both ES50 and beta diversity had similar richness in the tropics, mid-latitudes, and on the Antarctic shelf around 70°S. These 2 indices exhibited a sharp dip in the deep Southern Ocean at 55°S. ES50 peaked at 30°-35°S and a small dip was apparent near the equator at 5°-10°N. Beta diversity was driven mostly by turnover rather than nestedness.

Here, we determine if the realized climatic niche has changed during the expansion and analyse the geographic pattern of spread in Australia. Location Asia and Australia. Methods We collated occurrence records, divided the geographic range into three spatio-temporal phases (pre-expansion, early-expansion and late-expansion) and then developed ecological niche models for each phase. To determine whether the realized niche has changed during the range expansion, we performed a principal component analyses and niche overlap analysis. Finally, we calculated the annual rate of range expansion to estimate the speed and pattern of geographic spread. Results The climatic niche of A. terpsicore differs only slightly in the pre-expansion and late-expansion ranges and was most distinct in the early-expansion range. The species' range in Australia expanded at an average rate of 135 km/year (range: 34–359 km/year).

Main Conclusions Acraea terpsicore represents one of the fastest documented geographic range expansions of any species, highlighting how rapidly butterflies can colonize new areas, even where environmental conditions are substantially different to those in their original distribution. However, we found little evidence of climatic niche shift, and only a minor niche shift is apparent in the early-expansion and late-expansion ranges.

To varying degrees these species are costly to Australia’s horticulture through in-farm management, monitoring to demonstrate pest freedom, quarantine and trade restrictions, and crop losses. Here, we used a common species distribution model, Maxent, to assess climate suitability for these 11 species under baseline (1960–1990) and future climate scenarios for Australia. Projections indicate that the Wet Tropics is likely to be vulnerable to all 11 species until at least 2070, with the east coast of Australia also likely to remain vulnerable to multiple species. While the Cape York Peninsula and Northern Territory are projected to have suitable climate for numerous species, extrapolation to novel climates in these areas decreases confidence in model projections.

For scientists, CS offers a low-cost approach of collecting species occurrence information at large spatial scales that otherwise would be prohibitively expensive. We examined the trends and gaps linked to the use of CS as a source of data for species distribution models (SDMs), in order to propose guidelines and highlight solutions. We conducted a quantitative literature review of 224 peer-reviewed articles to measure how the representation of different taxa, regions, and data types have changed in SDM publications since the 2010s. Our review shows that the number of papers using CS for SDMs has increased at approximately double the rate of the overall number of SDM papers. However, disparities in taxonomic and geographic coverage remain in studies using CS. Western Europe and North America were the regions with the most coverage (71.2%). Papers on birds (51.2%) and mammals (26.2%) outnumbered other taxa. Among invertebrates, flying insects including Lepidoptera and Odonata received the most attention. Compared to studies on animal taxa, papers on plants using CS data remain rare. Although the aims and scope of SDM papers are diverse, conservation remained the central theme of SDM using CS data. We present examples of the use of CS and highlight recommendations to motivate further research, such as combining multiple data sources and promoting local and traditional knowledge.

Genetic patterns were examined using nine nuclear microsatellite loci and three chloroplast DNA markers.

Naturalized Australian populations displayed lower overall genetic variation and no phylogeographic patterns. Several naturalized populations separated by large distances (350&ndash;650 km) shared multi-locus genotypes, supporting the notion of a shared source of germplasm and possible inbreeding due to human-mediated introductions from a limited number of individuals and/or source populations within the native range.

My interests in biology started in natural history but, in the late 1960s as an undergraduate student, I was receptive to emerging new ideas in biogeography and evolutionary biology: continental drift and neutral theory. My focus in this “Perspective” is an explanation of how diversity has evolved in the frog fauna of southwestern Australia, where I have worked since 1978. I discuss the roles of range fragmentation, genetic drift, directional sexual selection, polyploidy, and simultaneous polyandry as processes driving the evolution of diversity in the sometimes-bizarre frog fauna of southwestern Australia. I identify features that can characterize polyandrous anurans: e.g., large testes, sperm morphology, and, possibly, complex calls with an example of the latter in Geocrinia leai. I discuss how current anuran life histories vary across rainfall and temperature gradients and how derivation of more-arid adapted forms is a well-defined historic biogeographic pattern in southwestern Australia.

Advertisement calls are species-specific, serve as a premating isolation mechanism, and reinforce species boundaries. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of interspecific variability of advertisement calls. Quantifying the variability of calls among individuals within a species and across species is critical to understand call evolution and species boundaries, and may build a foundation for further research in animal communication. However, collecting a large volume of advertisement call recordings across a large geographic area has traditionally posed a logistical barrier. We used data from the continental-scale citizen science project FrogID to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of call characteristics in six Australian frog species. We found intraspecific call variability in both call duration and peak frequency across species. Using resampling methods, we show that variability in call duration and peak frequency was related to the number of individuals recorded, the geographic area encompassed by those individuals, and the intra-annual time difference between those recordings. We conclude that in order to accurately understand frog advertisement call variation, or “anuran accents,” the number of individuals in a sample must be numerous (N ≥ 20), encompass a large geographic area relative to a species' range, and be collected throughout a species' calling season.",2020,2020-10-12 03:45:26,2021-02-28 02:09:45,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.1002/ece3.6833,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/YA77EZIW/Weaver et al. - 2020 - Anuran accents Continental-scale citizen science .pdf,,5 - ALA mentioned,10.1002/ece3.6833,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"2045-7758,2045-7758",2045-7758,Ecology and Evolution,Wiley,2020-10-06,2020,Anuran accents: Continental‐scale citizen science data reveal spatial and temporal patterns of call variability,2021-02-04T03:13:33.352610,

New fire regimes have the potential to drive species extinctions and cause ecosystem state changes, with a range of consequences for ecosystem services. Despite the co-occurrence of forest fires with drought, current approaches to modelling flammability largely overlook the large body of research into plant vulnerability to drought. Here, we outline the mechanisms through which plant responses to drought may affect forest flammability, specifically fuel moisture and the ratio of dead to live fuels. We present a framework for modelling live fuel moisture content (moisture content of foliage and twigs) from soil water content and plant traits, including rooting patterns and leaf traits such as the turgor loss point, osmotic potential, elasticity and leaf mass per area. We also present evidence that physiological drought stress may contribute to previously observed fuel moisture thresholds in south-eastern Australia. Of particular relevance is leaf cavitation and subsequent shedding, which transforms live fuels into dead fuels, which are drier, and thus easier to ignite. We suggest that capitalising on drought research to inform wildfire research presents a major opportunity to develop new insights into wildfires, and new predictive models of seasonal fuel dynamics.",2020,2020-07-28 02:17:05,2021-02-28 02:06:46,,779,,7,11,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,,10.3390/f11070779,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/9AT9ARE7/Nolan et al. - 2020 - Linking Forest Flammability and Plant Vulnerabilit.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Climate Data,10.3390/f11070779,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1999-4907,1999-4907,Forests,MDPI AG,2020-07-20,2020,Linking Forest Flammability and Plant Vulnerability to Drought,2021-12-19T13:46:06.141653,

This species is considered as the main prey of the hunter-gatherer groups of the Patagonian interior, indicating the existence of a strong ecological relationship of predator-prey type. Despite the importance of this ungulate for prehistoric human populations, its spatial distribution throughout the Holocene has not been systematically explored, assuming that it was ubiquitously distributed in almost all of Patagonia. In this work, the spatial distribution of the guanaco in Patagonia during different periods of the final Pleistocene and Holocene is explored using zooarchaeological and paleontological evidence together with species distribution models and paleoclimatic reconstructions. Likewise, the spatial variation in the importance of this species for the diet of human populations is assessed. The results show that there were large differences in the distribution of guanaco in Patagonia over time. In general terms, this camelid suffered a constant contraction in range since the Late Pleistocene period to the present. There is an Andean range and peri-cordilleran core of population distribution that remains observable during all this time. Human subsistence was strongly influenced by this pattern of distribution. The differences in the guanaco distribution described in this work are important not only for archaeological and paleontological problems, but also for the current conservation of guanacos.",2020,2021-02-10 04:58:47,2021-02-25 07:48:38,,095968362098168,,,,,,,,,,en,,,caf7f54d-d3e4-31a2-a627-4e84299fdd46,,Script,,10.1177/0959683620981689,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/SPPC8TGH/Rindel et al. - 2020 - The distribution of the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1177/0959683620981689,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,journal-article,closed,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"0959-6836,1477-0911",0959-6836,The Holocene,SAGE Publications,2020-12-21,2020,The distribution of the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in Patagonia during Late Pleistocene–Holocene and its importance for prehistoric human diet,2021-03-26T22:31:02.798454,

The data include Insecta (105,941 species), Arachnida (7984 species), Myriapoda (1229) and terrestrial crustaceans (270 Branchiopoda). The species were assigned to 14 543 higher taxonomic groups because such groups often characterize larger areas of endemism. Putative areas of endemism were visualized as sets of cells displaying unique groups of species without the assumption of hierarchical relationships. Yet, the use of 10° grid cells recovered many large areas broadly corresponding to biogeographic Regions (Nearctic, Neotropical, Panamanian, Palaearctic, Afrotropical, Australian, Oceanian and Oriental) albeit with the limits poorly defined. An analysis of 5° grids resulted in 306 sets included in the different biogeographic Realms: Afrotropical, Australian, Madagascan, Nearctic, Neotropical, Oceanian, Oriental, Palaearctic, Saharo‐Arabian and Sino‐Japanese. The Panamanian Realm comprises 89 partly overlapping sets, crossing the Nearctic and Neotropical boundaries. A total of 7338 species of Insecta were endemic to some areas (Sino‐Japanese, Afrotropical, Panamanian, Palaearctic, among others), followed by Arachnida (412 spp) and 105 species in other clades ranked as “classes”. Six sets were supported only by genera, except for Panamanian sets that were supported by genera and families.

The lack of baseline ecological and biogeographic information in the country, which are requisites to effective conservation, compounds this problem. To address this, we used maximum entropy modeling to predict suitable habitats of four Philippine endemic trees – Astronia cumingiana, and three threatened species, Astrocalyx calycina, Beccarianthus ickisii, and B. pulcherrimus (Astronieae: Melastomataceae) – under current climate conditions. We then predicted changes in their habitats for the years 2041–2060 and 2061–2080 under two future climate scenarios. We also assessed the level of protection that the species receive using the current protected area boundaries. Our models showed potentially suitable habitats for all species outside of their observed occurrence under the present climate, but their niches are generally predicted to shrink and ascend to higher altitudes when projected under future climate scenarios. The overlaps of their suitable niches outside protected area boundaries also increase southward, with Mindanao island possibly harboring the greatest number of unprotected Astronieae species. Our findings contribute to the emerging field of environmental niche modeling in the country and support the need to re-envision the country’s protected area system to move towards climate-smart local conservation strategies.",2020,2021-02-25 07:27:39,2021-02-25 07:27:39,,19,,,150,,,,,,,en,,,188b7e71-9e31-3e07-b41c-0306e4e28cb5,,Script,,-,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/LVDEIZRB/Mancera and Lapuz - Environmental Niche Models Reveal Receding Refugia.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Scientific understanding, biosecurity planning and practice, and pest management decision-making each suffer when such situations remain poorly understood. The pest bug Nezara viridula Linnaeus has been recorded from numerous host plants and has two globally distributed mitochondrial (mtDNA) lineages. These mtDNA lineages co-occur in few locations globally, and the consequences of their divergence and recent secondary contact have not been assessed. We present evidence that both mtDNA lineages of N. viridula are present in Australia and their haplotype groups have a mostly separate distribution from one another. The north-western population has only Asian mtDNA haplotypes, and the population with an eastern distribution is characterized mostly by European mtDNA haplotypes. Haplotypes of both lineages were detected together at only one site in the north of eastern Australia, and microsatellite data indicate that this secondary contact has resulted in mating across the lineages. Admixture and the movement of mtDNA haplotypes outside of this limited area of overlap has not, however, been extensive. Some degree of mating incompatibility or differences in the climatic requirements and tolerances of the two lineages, and perhaps a combination of these influences, might limit introgression and the movement of individuals, but this needs to be tested. This work provides the foundation for further ecological investigation of the lineages of N. viridula, particularly the consequences of admixture on the ecology of this widespread pest. We propose that for now, the Asian and European lineages of N. viridula would best be investigated as subspecies, so that “pure” and admixed populations of this bug can each be considered directly with respect to management and research priorities.",2020,2020-07-08 03:07:59,2021-06-28 06:52:42,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,GS 2020,10.26197/ 5e572 54d350f2,10.1111/eva.12971,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/298JD7SN/Brookes et al. - 2020 - Multiple invasions of a generalist herbivore—Secon.pdf,,1 - ALA used; Species occurrence records; ALA Data DOI,10.1111/eva.12971,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"1752-4571,1752-4571",1752-4571,Evolutionary Applications,Wiley,2020-06-22,2020,Multiple invasions of a generalist herbivore—Secondary contact between two divergent lineages ofNezara viridulaLinnaeus in Australia,2021-04-01T18:08:08.868956,

Participatory mapping and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 stakeholders and 22 managers and scientists to identify ecological priorities and concerns across a large temperate MPA in Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Australia. There were 19 iconic species of fish, dolphins, whales, and sea turtles that were the focus of ecological priorities and stakeholder interactions with the marine environment. Effectiveness of the current MPA management plan for addressing stakeholder priority and concerns, was assessed using GIS spatial modelling that created fuzzy-set species distribution models (SDMs) based on Traditional and Local Ecological Knowledge as well as scientific and citizen-science survey data. These spatial models for the iconic species across the MPA were then overlaid with ecological concerns of the stakeholders to create a spatial understanding of local threats, and priority areas for targeted management. Poor water quality from terrestrial primary sources was the main concern of stakeholders, more so than in-water threats such as poor fishing practices or impacts to iconic species. While local managers and scientists were relatively reluctant to answer interview questions, there was a general misalignment in approaches to iconic species management, especially for mobile and migratory species, and misunderstanding of stakeholder perceptions of threats.

The behaviour of floral visitors was quantified with direct observations and motion-triggered and hand-held cameras. Pollinator access to flowers was manipulated by enclosure in netting to either exclude all visitors or to exclude vertebrate visitors only. Apis mellifera was the only insect observed visiting flowers, and the most frequent flower visitor, but primarily acted as a pollen thief. Although birds visited A. manglesii plants only once per week on average, they were 3.5 times more likely to contact the anther or stigma as foraging honeybees. Exclusion of birds resulted in 67% fewer fruits and 81% fewer seeds than flowers left open and unmanipulated.

However, most studies have focused on a single trait, while controlling for additional factors in an informal way, generally by excluding taxa. This study utilized a dataset of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode sequences from over 7000 ray-finned fish species to test the effects of 27 traits on molecular evolutionary rates. Environmental traits such as temperature were considered, as were traits associated with effective population size including body size and age at maturity. It was hypothesized that these traits would demonstrate significant correlations with substitution rate in a multivariable analysis due to their associations with mutation and fixation rates, respectively. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to assemble and analyze sequence data retrieved from the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) and trait data obtained from FishBase. For use in phylogenetic regression analyses, a maximum likelihood tree was constructed from the COI sequence data using a multi-gene backbone constraint tree covering 71% of the species. A variable selection method that included both single- and multivariable analyses was used to identify traits that contribute to rate heterogeneity estimated from different codon positions.

The green tree frog (Litoria caerulea) has a vast range across northern and eastern Australia and New Guinea. An assessment of mitochondrial and morphological diversity in this nominal taxon in New Guinea reveals two taxa. True Litoria caerulea occurs in disjunct savannahs of the Trans-Fly, Central Province and across northern Australia, with very low genetic divergence, implying late Pleistocene connectivity. A previously unrecognised taxon is endemic to New Guinea and widespread in lowland swampy rainforest. Date estimates for the divergence of the new species suggest Pliocene connectivity across lowland tropical habitats of northern Australia and New Guinea. In contrast, the new species shows shallow phylogeographic structuring across the central mountains of New Guinea, implying recent dispersal between the northern and southern lowlands. These results emphasise that the extent and connectivity of lowland rainforest and savannah environments across northern Australia and southern New Guinea have undergone profound shifts since the late Pliocene. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:A577A415-0B71-4663-B4C1-7271B97298CD",2020,2021-07-26 02:35:16,2021-07-26 02:36:35,2021-07-26 02:35:16,25,,1,68,Aust.

Landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for examining evolutionary processes. We used genome-wide scans to genotype samples from populations of eight Angophora species. Angophora is a small genus within the eucalypts comprising common and rare species in a heterogeneous landscape, making it an appropriate group to study speciation. We found A. hispida was highly differentiated from the other species. Two subspecies of A. costata (subsp. costata and subsp. euryphylla) formed a group, while the third (subsp. leiocarpa, which is only distinguished by its smooth fruits and provenance) was supported as a distinct pseudocryptic species. Other species that are morphologically distinct could not be genetically differentiated (e.g., A. floribunda and A. subvelutina). Distribution and genetic differentiation within Angophora were strongly influenced by temperature and humidity, as well as biogeographic barriers, particularly rivers and higher elevation regions. While extensive introgression was found between many populations of some species (e.g., A. bakeri and A. floribunda), others only hybridized at certain locations. Overall, our findings suggest multiple mechanisms drove evolutionary diversification in Angophora and highlight how genome-wide analyses of related species in a diverse landscape can provide insights into speciation.

BILBI greatly refines the mapping of biodiversity patterns relative to more traditional surrogates such as ecoregions and species range maps. This capability is already proving of considerable value in informing global assessments through: 1) generation of indicators of past-to-present change in biodiversity resulting from habitat transformation or protection; and 2) projection of potential future change in biodiversity resulting from alternative global-change scenarios.",2020,2021-05-05 06:30:11,2021-06-29 05:24:37,,104806,,,132,,,,,,,en,,,de1eb4ee-41bb-307a-988c-bd6c18f8b2f1,,Script,,10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104806,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/SMDHPFPP/Hoskins et al. - 2020 - BILBI Supporting global biodiversity assessment t.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104806,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,1364-8152,1364-8152,Environmental Modelling & Software,Elsevier BV,2020-10-01,2020,BILBI: Supporting global biodiversity assessment through high-resolution macroecological modelling,2021-02-09T03:57:29.416779,

How this variation in biosecurity affects the invasion risks posed to the countries involved is unclear. We aimed to improve the understanding of how the biosecurity of a country influences that of its neighbours. We developed six scenarios that describe biological invasions in regions with contiguous countries. Using data from alien species databases, socio-economic and biodiversity data and species distribution models, we determined where 86 of 100 of the world's worst invasive species are likely to invade and have a negative impact in the future. Information on the capacity of countries to prevent invasions was used to determine whether such invasions could be avoided. For the selected species, we predicted 2,523 discrete invasions, most of which would have significant negative impacts and are unlikely to be prevented. Of these invasions, approximately a third were predicted to spread from the country in which the species first establishes to neighbouring countries where they would cause significant negative impacts. Most of these invasions are unlikely to be prevented as the country of first establishment has a low capacity to prevent invasions or has little incentive to do so as there will be no impact in that country. Regional biosecurity is therefore essential to prevent future harmful biological invasions. In consequence, we propose that the need for increased regional co-operation to combat biological invasions be incorporated in global biodiversity targets.",2020,2021-06-29 02:41:26,2021-06-29 05:17:48,,2449-2462,,4,26,,,,,,,,,,f26afce3-4dbd-322c-a7fb-b1dcd9764aa4,,Script,,10.1111/gcb.15006,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/Y9CBMGZ2/Faulkner et al. - 2020 - Stronger regional biosecurity is essential to prev.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,10.1111/gcb.15006,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,green,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"1354-1013,1365-2486",1354-1013,Global Change Biology,Wiley,2020-02-14,2020,Stronger regional biosecurity is essential to prevent hundreds of harmful biological invasions,2021-11-25T18:18:22.394999,

In Central Europe, specific lichens have been designated as climate change indicators; however, the lichen biota of central Europe has been substantially altered by air pollution and only re-established during the past decades—complicating the interpretation of recent changes in lichen composition. To assess their validity as climate change indicators, we aggregated georeferenced records of these taxa and compared their historic and modern distributions. Modern distributions substantially differed for fewer than half of the indicator taxa with sufficient data to enable evaluation—reinforcing their utility as climate change indicators. However, modern distributions for approximately half of the taxa evaluated were largely confined to historically suitable climates—raising questions about their utility as climate change indicators. We were unable to model historic distributions for nearly two-thirds of all indicator taxa due to insufficient data. About one-third of these had multiple modern records but one or fewer historic records, suggesting they may indeed be expanding their range; however, about half had comparable or greater numbers of historic records relative to modern records, complicating their interpretation as climate change indicators. Together, our work illustrates that distributions for fewer than half of the lichen climate change indicators have substantially shifted in the recent past, and calls into question whether the remaining designated taxa are indeed strong positive indicators of climate change.

Vigna is a pantropical genus with more than 88 taxa including important crops such as V. radiata (mung bean) and V. unguiculata (cowpea). Our results show that sources of pest and disease resistance occur in at least 75 percent of the Vigna taxa, which were part of screening assessments, while sources of abiotic stress resilience occur in less than 30 percent of screened taxa. This difference in levels of resilience suggests that Vigna taxa co-evolve with pests and diseases while taxa are more conservative to adapt to climatic changes and salinization. Twenty-two Vigna taxa are poorly conserved in genebanks or not at all. This germplasm is not available for legume breeding and requires urgent germplasm collecting before these taxa extirpate on farm and in the wild. Vigna taxa, which tolerate heat and drought stress are rare compared with taxa, which escape these stresses because of short growing seasons or with taxa, which tolerate salinity. We recommend prioritizing these rare Vigna taxa for conservation and screening for combined abiotic and biotic stress resilience resulting from stacked or multifunctional traits. The high presence of salinity tolerance compared with drought stress tolerance, suggests that Vigna taxa are good at developing salt-tolerant traits. Vigna taxa are therefore of high value for legume production in areas that will suffer from salinization under global climate change.",2020,2021-06-29 02:41:26,2021-06-29 02:41:26,,2111,,1,10,,,,,,,,,,9035f61a-85a6-3ea6-a87d-e2097fd7bf57,,Script,,10.1038/s41598-020-58646-8,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/NFWHD9RX/van Zonneveld et al. - 2020 - Mapping patterns of abiotic and biotic stress resi.pdf,,ALA GBIF DOI,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,

Nine populations were documented with an estimated area of occupancy of 0.43 km2 and area of extent measuring 95 km2, demonstrating that the current listing of H. calycina as vulnerable is appropriate on Tasmania’s Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. We believe that the distribution of the present population is a result of natural factors (i.e., restricted habitat range and natural fire events) and anthropogenic factors (managed fire regime and illegal firewood cutting).

Over several decades, metadata standards have been developed to facilitate the sharing and aggregation of this data, notably Darwin Core and ABCD (Access to Biological Collections Data) developed under the auspices of TDWG but other standards developed in other communities, have also proved useful notably EML (Ecological Metadata Language) and GML (Geography Markup Language).             Data aggregators have arisen to both, drive standards development and take advantage of the vast number of records made available through this community effort. Examples include Atlas of Living Australia and spin off Atlas projects, EoL (Encyclopedia of Life), iDigBio, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), WFO (World Flora Online).             There are still many “dark specimens” that are not visible to the web and efforts continue to digitise metadata on these objects and make them available. The vast majority of the data that has been liberated so far, has therefore been text based and the standards reflect this, although many institutions and projects are also producing large numbers of images and other media.             There have been media extensions to some standards to accommodate the sharing of images and other multimedia formats. However, these are restricted to metadata about media objects rather than the exchange of media objects themselves. For example, two extensions to Darwin Core are Audubon Core, which is designed to “determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media.” and the Simple Multimedia extension, which is a “simple extension for exchanging metadata about multimedia resources”. Therefore image exchange, in particular, has not used open standards. Projects have relied on transferring high resolution versions of images (e.g. submission of type specimen images to JSTOR) or cut down compressed versions (e.g. many herbarium specimens submitted to GBIF or Europeana).             The network has not allowed access to high resolution versions of images as curated by the host institutions themselves beyond basic links to web pages. If high resolution images have been published in online catalogues, they have been made available using a hotchpotch of different technologies including the now defunct Java Applets and Adobe Flash player. The network has not supported different views of the same specimen or annotations of those views, or integration of audio and moving images.             In an ideal world a researcher should be able to view and annotate images of specimens held across multiple collections in a unified way, and the host institutions should have access to those annotations and statistics on how their specimens are being used. How can we achieve this?             The sharing of multimedia representations of objects online is not a problem unique to the biodiversity community. Scholars in museums and archives of all kinds are facing the same issues. In 2011 the British Library, Stanford University, the Bodleian Libraries (Oxford University), the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Nasjonalbiblioteket (National Library of Norway), Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and Cornell University came together to develop an exchange standard called IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework). This framework now consists of six APIs (Application Programming Interface), four stable and two in beta, to publish and integrate image and other multimedia resources in a uniform manner and has been adopted by many institutions and commercial partners in the digital humanities. Applications based on IIIF enable many of the features desired by biodiversity researchers.             The notion of sharing and annotating specimen images is not new to the natural history community. MorphBank, founded in 1998, has grown to allow much of this desirable functionality but at the cost and fragility of being a centralised database. The question we should perhaps be asking is: how can we make the biodiversity data sharing network as a whole more like MorphBank?             From 2019 to 2021, part of the EU-funded Synthesys+ programme will support the adoption of IIIF as a unified way to publish images of natural history specimens. We aim to have a set of exemplar institutions publishing IIIF manifests for some millions of specimens by the end of the project and one or more demonstration applications in place. We hope this will act as a catalyst for wider adoption in the natural history community. A key goal is to integrate image data served using IIIF with metadata available via CETAF (Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities) specimen identifiers. If IIIF were ubiquitous in the natural history community, building tools that implemented this functionality would be feasible.             A brief demonstration of a herbarium specimen browser, Herbaria Mundi, will be given. It will illustrate how specimens hosted in different institutions can be manipulated in a single interface. The architecture that supports this behaviour will be explained and its challenges, by implementing the institutions discussed.",2020-10-05,2021-12-14 06:02:36,2021-12-14 06:03:12,2021-12-14 06:02:36,e59056,,,4,BISS,International Image Interoperability Framework,,,,,,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/losialagisz/Zotero/storage/6CLRIYTH/Hyam_2020_International Image Interoperability Framework.pdf,,3 - ALA discussed,10.3897/biss.4.59056,,,,2,TRUE,FALSE,journal-article,gold,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2535-0897,2535-0897,Biodiversity Information Science and Standards,Pensoft Publishers,2020-10-05,2020,International Image Interoperability Framework: A unified approach to sharing images of natural history specimens?,2021-02-04T02:37:40.555199,
